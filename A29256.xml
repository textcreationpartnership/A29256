            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving your Lordſhip's Commands for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of theſe following Diſcourſes, I have reaſon to hope my Readers will prove can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and favourable in their Cenſures, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but pay the greateſt Deference to the Judgment of a Prelate, whom all the Learned, both at home and abroad, do unanimouſly rank amongſt the greateſt Divines, that this, or former Ages can glory in. But that I may not too much leſſen that Eſteem, which the judicious part of Mankind, at leaſt, do justly bear to your Lordſhip, as the niceſt Judge in Things of this Nature, by proclaiming to the World that
<pb facs="tcp:40806:3"/> Encouragement you have given to a Work, which no doubt will be found very defective: I am apt to believe, and am forward to own it, that it might be more your Approbation of the Deſign, than the Goodneſs of the Performance that has made your Lordſhip ſo exceedingly kind to it, and its Author. And indeed if ever there were a neceſſity of attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting any thing to promote Catechetical Inſtruction, there is now too ſad an Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>Some Years ſince we thought it ſufficiently hard upon us, that we were put to the trouble of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church, ſo excellently Constituted as ours is, by ſuſteining thoſe ſlight Skimiſhes made only upon its Outworks; namely, againſt its Rites and Ceremonies (Solemnities I would rather call 'em) ſo wiſely order'd for the more grave and ſolemn Adminiſtration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, and for the better Edification of the Souls of Men. But alas the Enemy has now enter'd through our Breaches into the very heart of our City (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls the Church of God.) And as if there were an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Conſpiracy made at this time againſt it, <hi>All</hi> the Grand and Fundamental Articles, both of Natural and Revealed Religion, are now either most furiouſly ſtorm'd by Atheists, Deiſts, and Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on the one hand, or ſecretly and dangerouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Enthuſiaſts and Antinomians on the other. And if the next Generation ſhould grow worſe in its Principles and Morals than the preſent, what Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Heaven, even to the removing of our Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, may we not fear? But eſpecially, what Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God may not we of the Clergy dread, ſhould we ſuffer the Youth of our Nation to go abroad
<pb facs="tcp:40806:3"/> into the World, without having firſt given 'em thoſe Religious Impreſsions by good Principles, as will guard 'em from the danger thereof; and, eſpecially, without having firſt prepoſſeſs'd the Minds of ſuch, with a deep Tincture of Divine Knowledge, as are likely to be the Leading Men in their Countries; and yet by a fatal miſtake in Education, are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought up in thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndiſciplin'd Societies, amongst whom the <hi>Oracles</hi> of falſe and pretended <hi>Reaſon</hi> are more univerſally read, and more highly applauded, than the <hi>Lively Oracles of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know how deeply ſenſible your Lordſhip is of the growing Infidelity and Heterodoxy of this Age; and how much it is your Opinion, that a conſtant Courſe of Catechiſing our Youth in the Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, is the only means that can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually obviate and Cure thoſe Great and prevailing Evils. And if what I have here offered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, may be at all ſerviceable to any of my Brethren, in affording ſome uſeful Materials for their own Compoſures of this kind, and in aſſiſting any of 'em in their Method, I have my End, and ſhall therein in ſone meaſure anſwer, I preſume, your Lordſhip's Deſign; who, out of a pious Zeal to have this Work of Catechiſing univerſally ſet forwards by every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Miniſter in your Dioceſs, would have the way ſo plain'd, that we might all proceed therein without interruption.</p>
            <p>And ſure where the Authoritative Injunctions of ſo great a Father and Governor of our Church, are join'd with ſuch an unparalell'd Induſtry in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb facs="tcp:40806:4"/> of all the moſt Important and difficult Duties of the Epiſcopal Care, it is impoſſible for us, who are under the Influence of your Power and Example, to be Remiſs in that which is the very principal part of Miniſterial Inſtruction incumbent upon us. For if we no ſooner ſaw your Lordſhip entring upon that Dioceſs, to which you were Tranſlated ſo Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to us (though ſo diſadvantageouſly to your own Fortunes) but we ſaw you apply your ſelf with the utmoſt Vigour to the Buſineſs of it, in Viſiting not only your Clergy, but Cathedral, Schools, and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. If in your Lordſhip's primary Viſitation we heard ſuch a Learned Scriptural Proof of the <hi>JUS DIVINUM</hi> of the THREE DISTINCT ORDERS, (and what Evidence of that Nature is not to be expected from one ſo Mighty in the Holy Scriptures) as cannot but ſilence all Adverſaries, and all the Learned of our Nation would be glad to ſee made publick: If we alſo ſaw at the ſame time that Venerable Ordinance of Confirmation (even amongſt thoſe vast Crowds that came to it, and with ſo great a Fatigue to your ſelf) adminiſter'd with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application of the ſtipulatory part, to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Perſon, that was duly atteſted to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Qualified; and with that Order, Gravity, and Solemnity, which raiſed in all, who were preſent, that Value for it, which is due to it: If againſt every EMBER we ſee thoſe wiſe Precautions uſed, with Reference to the Candidates for Holy Orders, as would effectually prevent the admiſſion of Perſons unworthy, upon the account of any Immorality, or will wholly lay the Guilt at the Doors of thoſe who are
<pb facs="tcp:40806:4"/> backward to Inform their Church-Governors of the Miſcarriages they know, in order to their Correction and Remedy; and yet are moſt apt to raiſe their Outcries againſt the Scandals of the Clergy: And if alſo in the Probation of thoſe who are permitted to ſtand Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, there is conſtantly ſuch a Treaſury of Sacred Learning open'd to 'em in your Explications of Holy Writ, as renders thoſe Examinations one of the moſt learned and uſeful Theological Exerciſes that this Age does know; and is alone ſufficient to render thoſe in a good meaſure Qualified with Scriptural Knowledge, who come not thereto altogether prepar'd before-hand. And indeed, if agreeably to your Lordſhip's ſo uſeful Examinations, thoſe who have the Happineſs to be converſant with you in your Studies, do always ſee you ſearching the Scriptures, and do ſcarcely ever find you without the Holy Bible before you; (though one would think the ſacred Page need be no more turn'd over by one, who ſeems to have it wholly by heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, both in our own and all the Learned Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.) If farther yet we have ſeen your Lordſhip, by a Method equally worthy to be admired and imitated, in ſo ſhort time, to have got ſuch an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a numerous Clergy, that from the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Rector to the meanest Curate, our Abilities, Lives, and Miniſterial Performances, ſeem not to be better known to our neareſt Neighbours, than to your ſelf; and our Miſcarriages and Neglects of Duty in the remoteſt part of your Dioceſs, may almoſt as ſoon eſcape the Reproaches of our own Conſciences, as your Lordſhip's Notice and Animadverſion: If in a word ſuch is your Lordſhip's Vigilance through all the
<pb facs="tcp:40806:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> Parts of a very large Dioceſs, as is alone ſufficient to confute thoſe Voluminous Libels which were wrote ſome Years ſince againſt <hi>DIOCESAN EPISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PACY,</hi> as if an exact Diſcipline were not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable therein: If I ſay, ſuch an Authority will not awe us, nor ſuch an Example of Paſtoral Care will not animate us to diſcharge, as all the other, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch an indiſpenſably neceſſary a part of our Miniſterial Function as Catechiſing (particularly at this Juncture) undoubtedly is, this were enough to provoke Heaven to ſnatch from us the vaſt Benefit of ſuch a Paternal Government: Which Bleſſing that God may however continue to this Church, as it is heartily deſired by all that know your Lordſhip, (and are good enough themſelves juſtly to value the two beſt Things in the World, an unparallell'd Degree of Learning join'd with an equal meaſure of the moſt ardent Piety) ſo particularly it is the moſt earneſt and devout Prayers to God, of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAving a Deſign, if God permit, and if I ſhall find this preſent performance to be Candidly received, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Nature and Extent of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial, more particularly of Catechetical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which in the Nature of it, I think, would be the moſt proper Preface to this Work; but is a Porch too large to be prefix'd to one ſingle Wing of the Building; I ſhall only at preſent Advertiſe my Reader of two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, relating to this Firſt Volume of my Lectures; namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas I propoſed, Lecture the Fourth, in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Subject-Matter contained in theſe Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers, to treat both upon Divine Grace and of Prayer, as they are the means to enable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our part of the Covenant; and alſo to explain the Doctrine, and to juſtifie the Thing it ſelf of <hi>Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> or the admitting of Perſons into Covenant in the time of Infancy; as alſo the Uſe of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> therein, I was adviſed by ſome Learned Men to referr thoſe four laſt Points, and the Lectures upon 'em, rather to the latter end of the Catechiſm; the two former to be treated upon, when I come to the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and the Queſtion which leads to it; the two latter when I ſhall come to the Doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40806:6"/> where my Diſcourſes upon thoſe Subjects will be founded upon Queſtions and Anſwers more directly leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And as to the Subject of <hi>Renouncing the world, the Fleſh, and the Devil,</hi> it was thought it might be of good Uſe to enlarge upon that, there being nothing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Concernment, eſpecially to Youth, than a plain and practical diſcovery of thoſe various Temptations which will ariſe from all theſe our Spiritual Adverſaries, and are likely to aſſault them above others. And becauſe this Condition in our Covenant with God, of Renouncing the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, does not again recurr in any part of the Catechiſm to be more particularly handled, as the others of Faith and Obedience do; for theſe Reaſons it is, that my Expoſition of that Point has run out into a length ſo much improportionable to the reſt, inſomuch that that part takes up half the Book.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which in the next place I am to account for, is the 23d. Lecture; which is an Epitome of a Book, ſtil'd the <hi>Meaſures of Chriſtian Obedience,</hi> a Work, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, both well-known and eſteem'd. That Reverend Author, had, in my Opinion, given ſo full a ſtate of the Condition of our Coveeant, <hi>viz.</hi> Evangelical Obedience, that I thought I ſhould do an Injury to my <hi>Catechumen,</hi> ſhould I paſs it by, and give him a worſe, and more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one of my own. Whether it would have been eaſier to me to contract that Diſcourſe, than to make a new ſtate of the Point, ſuch as I might call my own, I cannot readily gueſs; but if it was, I hope ſome allowance will be given for taking one ſuch Reſt as this may appear to be, ſince in the whole Scheme of Doctrine upon theſe <hi>Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers,</hi> I have been forc'd to tread in ſomething an unbeaten Path.</p>
            <p>And now with my earneſt Prayers to God, that he would give his Bleſſing to what is herein no otherwiſe than honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd, I ſhall only at preſent intreat the candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to put a favourable Conſtruction upon what has been here offer'd him, by one who is too ſenſible of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencies, to be pertinacious in maintaining any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:40806:6"/> the ſenſe of his Superiors; but eſpecially who is Religiouſly careful to advance nothing contrary to the Doctrine of our Church: Which that I might not do, I have, and ſhall all along endeavour to take in as much as I can, both of Matter and Expreſſion from its Eſtabliſhed Forms and Offices.</p>

               <hi>THE Firſt Lecture.</hi> A Catechiſm, that is to ſay, an Inſtruction to be Learned of every Perſon, before he be brought to be Confirmed by the Biſhop.</head>
            <p>THIS is the Title of your Catechiſm, which you are now learning; and before I proceed to diſcourſe on the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm it ſelf, I thought it proper, from theſe Words, to define what a Catechiſm means, and to let you know the Benefit and Uſe of Catechizing.</p>
            <p>As for the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to Catechize,<note place="margin">The Meaning of the Word Catechize.</note> it is often met with in the Holy Scriptures, particularly <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.4. where it is taken in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſenſe we now uſe it, wherein it does import a more General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in thoſe Chriſtian Truths, which are afterwards to be more particularly and diſtinctly learnt by us; for ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> Dedicating his Goſpel to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> tells him <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4.<note place="margin">Senſus loci <hi>q.</hi> d. ut ea quae olim Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus viva voce didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſti nunc plenius ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certius cognoſcas. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſ.</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That it ſeemed good to him, having had perfect knowledge of all thoſe things from the very firſt, to write them in order to him, that he might know the certainty,</hi> or have a more full and particular Underſtanding <hi>of thoſe things wherein he had been before Catechized,</hi> (for ſo it is in the very Letter of the Greek) that is taught only in General to prepare him for Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heſychius,</hi> a Learned Grammarian, does give the meaning of this word Catechize, by another which ſignifies to Build; and this does intimate to us the Matter of which a Catechiſm muſt conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the main and fundamental Points of Religion, ſuch as are fitteſt to build up a firm and unſhaken Chriſtian withal.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is deriv'd from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies an inculcating and ſounding often in the Ear of the Learner, the Principles to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed and fixed in his Mind and Memory. So the Heathens, and ſo the Chriſtians uſed the Word.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice for the Importance of the Word, which I thought might not be improper to Note, becauſe it gives ſo much Light into the Meaning of the Thing, and the Nature of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, which I ſhall therefore Define as follows, taking the Title now read, with ſome Explanatory Additions, for the Text upon which I ſhall Comment.</p>
            <p>A Catechiſm is a general Inſtruction in the Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">The Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm.</note> neceſſary to be Learnt of every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in order to his Confirmation; or the ſolemn Renewing of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal

            <p>Firſt, As to the Matter of which a Catechiſm is to conſiſt: <hi>It is a General Inſtruction in the Fundamental Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the Perſons to be ſo Inſtructed: <hi>It is neceſſary to be Learnt of every Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to the End of a Catechiſm: It is neceſſary to be Learnt of every Perſon <hi>in order to his Confirmation, or the ſolemn Renewing of his Baptiſmal Covenant and Vow before the Biſhop, and the receiving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Biſhop's Bleſſing, Prayers, and Laying on of Hands.</hi> Of all which Particulars I ſhall diſcourſe to you in their Order.</p>

                  </gap>
               </note>That Morality, or a good Life, is a neceſſary and eſſential Part of Chriſtianity, is expreſly affirm'd by St. <hi>James,</hi> 1.27. where he tells us, That <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled, before God and the Father</hi> (or ſuch as God the Father will accept) <hi>is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their afflictions, and to keep one ſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi> Many ſeem to place it in little leſs than Morality; but it is the Life and Soul of all Religion, as in reſpect of God, to Love, Honour, and to Obey him; to Truſt in him, and to Reſign one ſelf to him; to Worſhip him, and to be Devoutly given: So in reſpect of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to be Juſt and Charitable; and particularly, and eſpecially to Relieve thoſe that are in Diſtreſs: And Laſtly, as to our ſelves, to govern our Affections, to ſubdue our Paſſions, to mortify our Luſts, and to moderate our Deſires: In a word, To keep the Heart and Life clean from the Defilements of Sin. In this, I ſay, conſiſts One main Part of Religion, in abſtaining from all Sin and Wickedneſs, and in a conſtant and ſteddy Performance of all the Parts of Vertue and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>This, I am ſure, is a main Part of the Chriſtian Religion, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that our Saviour came to Plant amongſt Men, for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> He appeared teaching us to deny all Ungodlineſs; and he gave himſelf for us to redeem us from all Iniquity. Hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tended all he ſaid, all he did, and all he ſuffer'd. This was the Deſign of his excellent Sermons and Diſcourſes, of his moſt admirable Example and Life, and of his Death and Sufferings, to Root out of the Lives of Men whatſoever is Sinful and Wicked, and to Implant in its ſtead all the Parts of Vertue and Goodneſs.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40806:8"/>
            <p>But Secondly, It is not enough to make a Man a good Chriſtian,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> To Act Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly upon Chriſtian Principles.</note> that he live a ſtrict and unblamable Life; but it is moreover neceſſary to render him ſuch, that he act Virtuouſly upon Chriſtian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Both indeed are neceſſary to the conſtituting a Man a true Chriſtian. The moſt regular Life that can be, except it be Acted upon Chriſtian Principles, is but meer Morality at the beſt; as the moſt Orthodox Belief that is, if it be Barren in good Works, is but a dead Faith. Thus Temperance may be obſerv'd becauſe of our Health, and plain and punctual Dealing by the Men of Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Intereſt. Men may Faſt and Pray out of Hypocriſy, and to appear Good to others; and may diſtribute large Alms to gain the Applauſe of Men, as you may ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, 5. And indeed conſidering that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all things, having the promiſe of the Life that now is,</hi> as well as <hi>of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. And ſince of the Chriſtian Religion it may be ſaid, that <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace;</hi> Men may lead very blameleſs Lives in all reſpects, becauſe of the Advantage and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Mind, that ariſes meerly from a regular and orderly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: But all this will be accounted by God to fall far ſhort of the Chriſtian Religion, and will entitle the Man to no Reward in Heaven, that acts upon no better Reaſons nor Motives than theſe: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you they have their reward,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>Nay, He that lives an orderly, good, moral Life upon the Belief only that there is a God, that his Providence and Care is extended over us, that our Souls ſhall never Dye, but are capable of, and ſhall receive Rewards or Puniſhments in another world, can be only ſaid to be ſo far Religious, as the good Moral Heathens were, who Believ'd and Acted upon the Principles of Natural Religion only; and who <hi>having no other Law did by Nature the things contain'd in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.14. But to conſtitute a Man truly Religious, and to denominate his Religion the Chriſtian Religion, it is farther neceſſary, that he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Act upon Chriſtian Principles, ſuch as not the Light of Nature only, but the Goſpel of our Saviour does reveal unto us, for <hi>in the day when he ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it will be, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>according to his Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2.16. And ſo main a part in his Goſpel were the Principles of reveal'd Religion, that he told the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> he <hi>determined not to know any thing amongſt them ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. that is, the Means and Methods of our Salvation by a Crucified Saviour (which can be known only by Revelation) he was reſolv'd ſhould be ſo much the Subject of his Preaching amongſt them, that they might almoſt conclude he himſelf knew nothing elſe, and did not much care whether they did alſo. Thus the Chriſtian Religion you ſee, is out of Chriſtian Principles to lead an holy, good Life.</p>
            <p>Nor Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Dependance upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt, that our imperfect Righteouſneſs may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> Is it enough to render the Religion of us Chriſtians compleat, that by the force of good Chriſtian Principles we lead good Lives; but to together therewith, we muſt depend upon the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt with the Father for us, that our imperfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be graciouſly accepted to our Juſtification. For alas! the beſt of us all muſt conſider this, that when we have done all that is commanded us, we are but <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. But alas! the beſt of us all do exceedingly fail in doing all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40806:9"/> us; for <hi>we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory,</hi> or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation <hi>of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23. And therefore, as there is <hi>One Mediatour between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. So we are ſtrictly commanded <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. that <hi>whatſoever we do in word or in deed, we ſhould do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And particularly as to that ſo conſiderable part of Religion, <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is ordain'd, we are told <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>That whatſoever we ſhall ask of the Father in his Name he will give it us:</hi> And alſo as to that other great Duty of Chriſtian Worſhip, <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> we are ſolemnly enjoin'd <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.17.20. <hi>As we will ſhew our ſelves not to be unwiſe, but underſtanding what the Will of the Lord is, to give thanks always for all things unto God the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>In him we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the Faith of him</hi> Eph. 3.12. The Meaning of which, and innumerable other places, that might be produc'd to this purpoſe, is this, That conſidering our own Vileneſs and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of our Sins, we ſhould ground all our Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Favour and Acceptance, and Reward, ſolely upon Chriſt: That we ſhould offer all our Deeds to God, as Sacrifices and Services unworthy of Acceptance in themſelves, and as proceeding from us, but pleaſing and acceptable to God, only for his ſake.</p>

As to a good Moral Life, ſome Pagans did arrive to great degrees in Virtue (ſuch as I wiſh may not riſe in Judgment againſt us Chriſtians now a-days:) And as for their Acting this upon good Principles, I can hardly imagine, that thoſe who had ſuch noble and worthy Thoughts of God, and of their own Souls, and who plac'd their Happineſs in Purity and Uprightneſs, were ſo much wanting in that Ingredient alſo of Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> The Acting it upon good Principles, as ſome do think. They ſeem to me only to have wanted the Knowledge and Belief of ſome more and better Principles which we do enjoy, to render their Virtue compleat in that reſpect alſo. But that the beſt of our Performances are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that it was thought requiſite in the Divine Wiſdome, that the Son of God ſhould become a Sacrifice to expiate their Guilt, and a Mediatour with his Father to obtain their Acceptance, is what the proud Hearts of natural Men never thought of, and no Religion but the Chriſtian ever taught: But on the contrary, when they had done well, they did proudly over-value it, and did arrogantly challenge the Reward, not as of Grace, but of Debt.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40806:9"/> 
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. This does eminently ſet forth the exceeding Luſtre of his Mercy towards us in the Goſpel, that our Imperfect, if ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhall be accepted through the Mediation of Chriſt. It does utterly exclude Boaſting, and all occaſions of proud Reflections on our Parts, as if ſo mean an Obedience as ours, could deſerve ſuch infinite Rewards, as are made over to us in the Goſpel; a Temper of Mind, which as it is very apt to get Entertainment in our Souls, ſo ought of all things to be ſuppreſt within us. And thus I have given you a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger account of the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, than otherwiſe I ſhould have done, that I might clear the way towards coming to the Knowledge of thoſe <hi>Fundamental Principles</hi> thereof; which I told you are the proper Matter of a Chriſtian Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>And now anſwerably hereunto,<note place="margin">The Nature of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> the fundamental Principles of our Religion muſt be ſuch Doctrines, as being well underſtood, and throughly believ'd, do moſt powerfully and forcibly perſwade and move Men to be thus Religious; as to tend to deſtroy the Power of Sin, to mortify our Luſts, and all wicked Inclinations within us, to render us pious and devout towards God, juſt and charitable and peaceable Neighbours, and ſober, chaſt and orderly Livers in this World: And which ſhall withal create in us ſuch an humble Opinion of our own Unworthineſs, that when we have done all that we can, to deny our ſelves, and have proceeded never ſo far in our Zeal to good Works, we ſhall nevertheleſs, confeſſing that we are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, depend wholly on Chriſt's Merits and Mediation, and in the Virtue of his Satisfaction and Interceſſion alone, expect Salvation.</p>
            <p>And now ſuch is the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">An Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of Fundamental Principles.</note> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that part of it, the Vow in Baptiſm, wherein all do ſolemnly promiſe and vow Repentance, Faith and Obedience; engaging to renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil.

It is the Glory of our Church that ſhe Impoſes no other Doctrines, as neceſſary to be Learnt by her Children, than thoſe already mention'd, which are plainly declared in Scripture to be Fundamental and Neceſſary Principles, whereon we may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build a Good Life, and the certain Hopes of Eternal Happineſs; and which are ſo firm a Rock, that the Religion and Hopes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs founded upon it, will not eaſily be deſtroy'd by the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and boiſtrous Temptations that the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, ſhall Aſſault it withal, thereby to Ruine it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I Adventured in as few Words, as the Difficulty of the Argument would give me leave, to ſhew you the Nature of <hi>Fundamental Principles,</hi> and to declare to you what Doctrines are to be accounted ſuch, ſo far at leaſt, as they are the Matter of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetical Inſtruction, and the Buiſineſs of a Catechiſt to inform you of them.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40806:10"/>
            <p>I have done this Point when I have told you, That a Catechiſm is <hi>A General Inſtruction only, in the Fundamental Principles of Chriſtianity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Catechiſm is a General Inſtruction in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</note> As a Catechiſm ought not to be crouded with any thing more than what is purely Fundamental to a Good Life here, and Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; ſo even thoſe Fundamental Truths it ought to deliver in as ſhort and comprehenſive a manner, as poſſible; for a Catechiſm is an Inſtruction that muſt be fitted to all, even the weakeſt Capacities, and therefore it ought to be ſuch a Form of ſound Words, as all can retain: And the more explicite and enlarged Knowledge of theſe things is to be ſought for in the Expoſitions and Comments that are given of them in Catechetical Diſcourſes, of which Nature I deſign, by God's Grace, to Preſent you with ſome, until I have gone through your Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>In a word, and to conclude this Firſt Point:<note place="margin">Such were the Ancient, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms.</note> Such a General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Fundamental and moſt Neceſſary Points of Religion, as we have given you an account of, was the Matter of which the Ancient Catechiſms did moſtly conſiſt, even in the time of the Apoſtles, and ſuch is the Catechiſm you are now Learning.</p>
            <p>As to the ancient Catechizing in the Apoſtles times, as it is plain from the Example of <hi>Theophilus, Luk.</hi> 1.4. that the New Converts received their firſt Notions of Religion by Catechizing, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerv'd: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. we read of a <hi>Form of Doctrine that was delivered to them,</hi> which the beſt Interpreters ſuppoſe to have been a Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, or Body of Catechetical Points: And what thoſe Points were, which they firſt taught them, we have expreſly laid down <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. from whence it appears, that thoſe <hi>Firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> were, for the moſt part, the very ſame I have now mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrines of Repentance, Faith, and of the Sacraments: They are alſo called there the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which being laid, the Apoſtle tells them, he will go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them by other Teaching.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a general Inſtruction alſo is the Catechiſm you are now Learning, and which I am at preſent about to Expound to you.<note place="margin">And ſuch is our Church Catechiſm.</note> You have therein indeed given you a Summary Doctrine of all the Fundamental and Neceſſary Articles of Chriſtianity. And the Seed of theſe Catechetical Points, if they be but receiv'd into well-diſpos'd Hearts, will in time, by God's Grace, produce a plentiful Crop of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge: So that I may very ſafely Affirm it, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of you ſhall learn to underſtand throughly his Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, ſhall be ſufficiently inſtructed to Salvation; and whoſoever ſhall live according to thoſe Principles therein taught, need no more to render him a good Chriſtian in this World, and an happy Saint in the World to come.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the Firſt Point in my Deſcription of a Catechiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> The Matter of which a Catechiſm is to conſiſt; that it is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtruction in the Fundamental and Neceſſary Principles of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The next, are the Perſons that are to be Catechized,<note place="margin">The Perſons that are to be Catechized, are every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and in the Definition I have given of a Catechiſm, it is ſaid to be <hi>An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction neceſſary to be Learnt of every Perſon.</hi> It is very certain that whoever would be skilful in any Art or Science whatſoever, he muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40806:11"/> endeavour firſt to underſtand the Principles of it. This is every Day's Experience: He that would be a good Grammarian, or Latin Scholar, muſt firſt learn to underſtand his Grammar Rules; you know it is impoſſible to read at all before you know your Letters, or to read well till you can ſpell or diſtinguiſh between the Syllables. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, He that would be a knowing, and withal a ſtable Chriſtian (as it is every Body's infinite Concern to be both) he muſt make it his Care and Buſineſs to become well inſtructed in the Principles (thoſe which we call the fundamental Points) of the Chriſtian Doctrine: That the way to Perfection in the Chriſtian, as well as other Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, is to begin with the Principles of it, appears from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to perfection.</hi> Hereby you ſee, that his Method in Teaching, was firſt to begin with grounding in the Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and then to proceed to higher things; and the ſame Method the Apoſtle took in teaching of Religion, the ſame muſt the Diſciples be ſuppoſed to do in learning of it. If the Apoſtle began with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Principles, the Diſciples muſt begin with the learning of them. And the Wiſdom of laying firſt a Foundation of good Principles, and building our Religion upon them, and the Folly on the other ſide of not laying a good Foundation of ſuch, is ſufficiently repreſented in that Parable of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24. The wiſe Man, he there tells us, <hi>Built his houſe upon a Rock,</hi> or a Foundation of good Principles, <hi>and when the rain deſcended, and flouds came, and winds blew and beat upon that houſe, it fell not, for it was founded upon a Rock. But the fooliſh man he built his houſe upon the Sand,</hi> upon none at all, or a very ſorry Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and mark the Fate of that Man's Religion, when the <hi>Flouds came, and the Winds blew and beat upon that Houſe, it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> A Perſon well grounded in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall be able to bear the Shock of the fierceſt Temptations, But a Perſon of no Principles ſhall not be able to withſtand the leaſt.<note place="margin">The neceſſity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Nor is it deſign'd by our Church for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Children only: But a <hi>Catechiſm is an Inſtruction neceſſary to be learnt of every Perſon,</hi> indifferently, <hi>before he be brought to be Confirmed by the Biſhop,</hi> as appears by the Title and Deſcription of your Catechiſm, on which Words I am now diſcourſing, which brings me to ſpeak to what End Catechizing is deſign'd.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The End of Catechizing to prepare for Confirmation.</note> 
               <hi>And it is deſign'd to prepare you to be Confirm'd by the Biſhop.</hi> Confirmation is an open Profeſſion from the Mouth of One formerly Baptized, and now come to Years of Diſcretion, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop and the Congregation of Chriſt's Church, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, and Ratifying that Vow made in Baptiſm by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers in his behalf, with a ſolemn Promiſe,<note place="margin">Confirmation, What?</note> that he will Endeavour in his own Perſon, according as was Engag'd for him, to Renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, to Believe in God, and to Obey him. This on the part of the Perſon Confirm'd: And then on the Biſhop's part, It conſiſts in his ſolemn Prayers to God, to enable the Party, by the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to do the ſame; and in his Epiſcopal and Fatherly Benediction, or Bleſſing of him, together with his Laying on of Hands, after the Example of the Holy Apoſtles, to certify him of God's Favour and gracious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him. This is the Doctrine of Laying on of Hands, or Confirmation, entire and unmaim'd in either of its eſſential Parts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40806:12"/> according as it is deliver'd in our Church, and is order'd to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, both by thoſe who come to this Holy Inſtitution, and by thoſe who are Intruſted with the Adminiſtration of it: And a Rite it is both greatly Neceſſary, and of ſingular Benefit in the Church of Chriſt.</p>

The Perſon to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, having Renew'd that Solemn Promiſe and Vow that was made in his Name at his Baptiſm, Ratifying and Confirming the ſame in his own Perſon: The Biſhop does then proceed to <hi>Beſeech God to Strengthen him with the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, and daily to increaſe in him his manifold Gifts of Grace, the Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Ghoſtly Strength, the Spirit of Knowledge and true Godlineſs, and to fill him with the Spirit of his Holy Fear:</hi> And does moreover add his own Fatherly Benediction in theſe Words, <hi>Defend, O Lord, this thy Servant with thy Heavenly Grace, that he may continue thine for ever, and daily increaſe in thy Holy Spirit more and more, until he come to thine everlaſting Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if the <hi>Effectual fervent Prayer of any Righteous man avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. how much more maybe expected from the Interceſſions of One, who has, not only on the account of his own Perſonal Righteouſneſs, but by Virtue of his Office alſo, an Intereſt in God, and the Priviledge of an eaſier Acceſs, and of nearer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to him in Divine Offices: And who is Commiſſion'd to Pray to God in the behalf of others, and is Authoriz'd to <hi>Bleſs the People in his Name?</hi> Why this is the Power and Priviledge that the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had given them under the Law and Goſpel both: Under the Law, as you will ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17. and alſo under the more Spiritual Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, as may be ſeen <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. So that much Benefit may, without doubt, be expected from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prayers and Paternal Benediction, or Bleſſing of a Father of the Church, for God will ever have a particular Regard to his own Inſtitutions, and will Bleſs thoſe Means of conveying his Grace, which he himſelf has Appointed.</p>
            <p>But then eſpecially you may promiſe your ſelves a favourable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Biſhop's Prayers and Fatherly Benediction, when it is alſo accompany'd with the Solemnity of Laying on of Hands. This has in all Diſpenſations, before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpel, been Uſed both by Natural Parents, and by the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fathers of the Church, as a Solemn way of their Bleſſing. Thus <hi>Jacob Bleſſed his Sons, Laying his Hands upon their Heads,</hi> Gen. 48.17. So <hi>Aaron lifted up his Hands towards the People, and Bleſſed them,</hi> Lev. 9.22. And our Saviour alſo, <hi>When the little Children were brought unto him, he put his Hands upon them and Bleſſed them,</hi> Mark 10.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40806:13"/> 16. No doubt thoſe Great Perſons did not Intend hereby a fruitleſs Ceremony, but they did Deſign their Laying on of Hands, together with their Bleſſing, ſhould have a Spiritual Effect, or elſe ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would not have Uſed it. But to put us out of doubt concerning the Graces, that will Attend the Prayers and Benedictions, together with the Laying on of Hands of the Fathers of the Church, we have a plain Inſtance thereof in what <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 17. who when they came down to the lately Baptized Converts of <hi>Samaria, They Pray'd for them, that they might Receive the Holy Ghoſt, and then Laid their Hands upon them, and they Receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And tho' the Gifts that then follow'd the Laying on of the Hands of the Apoſtles, may be ſuppoſed to have been Extraordinary Gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Infant State of the Church did then require ſuch to Raiſe and Support it; yet the ſame Laying on of Hands after the Example of the Holy Apoſtles, and that by their Succeſſors in the Church of Chriſt, the Biſhops, may be expected to have ſtill ſuch Graces ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, as in this preſent State of the Church, will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you, and that thereupon the <hi>Fatherly Hand of God will ever be over you, that his Holy Spirit will ever be with you, and that he will ſo Lead you in the Knowledge and Obedience of his Word, that in the End you may attain everlaſting Life, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus I have at length ſhew'd you what it is to be Confirm'd by the Biſhop, and withal how Neceſſary and Beneficial it is to the Souls of Men, to be ſo Confirm'd.</p>

For why? In your Confirmation you do Voluntarily and of Choice take upon you that Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which before, in your Minority, was done by others in your behalf. And it is neceſſary before you take upon your ſelves ſo great and weighty a Buſineſs, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, that you be firſt Inſtructed, ſo as to underſtand them well, both what thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Repentance, Faith and Obedience are; and what mighty Bleſſings God Vouchſafes to make over to you in the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that ſhould be an Encouragement, and reaſonable Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you, to undertake ſo great and weighty a Charge. Juſt as in the caſe of a Perſon under Age, who, by reaſon of his Minority, being uncapable of himſelf to Enter into any Covenants, his Truſtees may do it for him: But when he is come to Age, and muſt Seal to, and Confirm ſuch Covenants himſelf, it is requiſite he have them Read to him, and be made to Underſtand what Advantages accrue to him thereby, before he Confirm them in his own Perſon.</p>
            <p>But why not this Inſtruction, rather before Baptiſm than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation? It is in Baptiſm that we Enter into Covenant with God, and Catechetical Inſtruction ſhould therefore properly go before that, you'll ſay.</p>
            <p>And in the beginning of Chriſtianity indeed, when the Parties Baptized were, for the moſt part, Perſons grown up to Years of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40806:13"/> who Abandoning their Heatheniſh, or Jewiſh Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices, gave themſelves up to be Chriſt's Diſciples, it was required that ſuch, even before they were Baptized, ſhould be firſt Catechized in the Principles of Chriſtianity, and be made to underſtand the Conditions of that Covenant, which by their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm they were to Enter into with God. And ſo it is ſtill requiſite, that all New Converts from Paganiſm, or Judaiſm, or Mahometiſm, or any other contrary Religion, ſhould be likewiſe firſt Inſtructed before they be Admitted to Baptiſm, becauſe ſuch being as well to Unlearn, as it were, their former falſe Religion, as to Learn the true Chriſtian Profeſſion; they ought therefore to Underſtand both, e're they can well Renounce that, or before they can Reaſonably put on, or Embrace this. But as to you who are the Children of Chriſtian Parents, your Caſe is quite different, for having no falſe Religion to Unlearn and Renounce, and having a kind of Right of Inheritance, by Virtue of your Chriſtian Parentage, to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, even in your Infancy, into the Profeſſion of the True; It is therefore ſufficient that you be Inſtructed, after your Baptiſm, in the Nature and Tenour of the Baptiſmal Covenant, provided that when ſo Inſtructed, you afterwards appear Solemnly to Confirm it before Chriſt's Ambaſſadour, the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>But then it is highly neceſſary you ſhould be ſo Catechized and Inſtructed before you Perſonally undertake a Matter of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that ſo when you come to make a ſolemn and publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſuch an Undertaking, you may do it in a way and manner, that becomes reaſonable and wiſe Perſons to do ſo great a thing in, who always know and conſider the Weight and Conſequence of Matters of Moment, e're they will Solemnly make a Profeſſion of them, or Undertake them. So neceſſary is Catechizing in order to the Renewing and Ratifying in Confirmation, that Covenant and Vow which was made in Baptiſm.</p>

As Beneficial as theſe really are to all thoſe, who ſhall come duly Prepared, yet it is certain, that without ſome neceſſary Qualifications in ſuch as come to be Confirm'd (amongſt which, to underſtand the Nature, Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, and ſeriouſly to Intend to Perform the ſame, are the firſt and chief) none will be much the better for the Biſhop's Prayers, Benediction, or Impoſition of Hands. Theſe may be a Means indeed of Obtaining the Graces of the Holy Spirit, to Enable thoſe, that underſtand their Baptiſmal Vows and Covenant with God, to perform ſuch their Engagements, but they are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have any Operation upon thoſe, who underſtand not what a Covenant of Grace does mean. And therefore Catechizing, which is the only proper Means to give you ſuch an Underſtanding, muſt needs be exceedingly neceſſary to your being Benefited alſo by what the Biſhop ſhall perform in your Confirmation.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the Nature, Neceſſity and End of Catechizing, ſo far as the Title of your Catechiſm does give us occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it. And if we conſider it ſo far only, you have a great deal of reaſon to value Catechizing as a moſt neceſſary and uſeful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40806:14"/> Kind of Inſtruction, ſo as to need no great Invitation to it. The Points you ſee therein taught, are the moſt ſubſtantial and weighty Truths of Religion. The Perſons to be ſo Inſtructed, are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently any Perſons of whatever Age, Sex, or Quality, till they come to a competent Underſtanding of thoſe moſt neceſſary Points, as has been Practiced in the Apoſtle's Times, and the Primitive Church. And the End thereof you ſee, is no leſs than to render you capable to Confirm that Covenant with God, wherein are contain'd the Higheſt and moſt Valuable Priviledges in the World, and which coſt the moſt ineſtimable Price to purchaſe them for us, even the Blood of Chriſt, and which except you ſhall ſecure your ſelves an Intereſt in, you are deſperate and undone Perſons.</p>
            <p>And now each of theſe Conſiderations are Reaſons ſufficient to bring you to be Catechized, and to make you value it, as a great Happineſs you may be ſo Inſtructed to your Soul's health. But that nothing may be left unſaid, to raiſe in your Minds a due Eſteem of Catechizing, and to perſwade you to Attend it; I ſhall over and above what the Title of your Catechizing directly leads me to ſay concerning it, give you to underſtand ſeveral other good Uſes to which Catechizing ſerves, as ſo many Arguments to Invite you to it.</p>

            <p>Well, but there are ſeveral other good Ends and Purpoſes to which Catechizing ſerves, and becauſe the Knowing of them may increaſe your Eſteem thereof, and cauſe you the better to attend it, I will beſtow One other Diſcourſe in ſhewing you what they are, before I proceed to Expound the Catechiſm it ſelf. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for Confirmation,<note place="margin">Catechizing requiſite to prepare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</note> ſo it is alſo requiſite to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you that you may be <hi>Worthy Communicants in the Lord's Supper.</hi> Juſt as in Confirmation, ſo in the Lord's Supper, we do ſolemnly, tho' not ſo publickly Ratify and Renew our Covenant with God; and for the ſame reaſon therefore, that Catechizing is requiſite to prepare you for Confirmation, it muſt be alſo neceſſary to fit you for worthy Communicants, that you may Communicate with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and as Perſons that underſtand what they do. And alas! To what is it but to their having been never Inſtructed in their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> by Catechizing, that ſo many come ſo Ignorantly, or elſe not at all to the Lord's Supper.

No ſurely, if all Chriſtians had been but Catechized in thoſe Points, both what a mighty Priviledge it is to be in Covenant with God, and that Receiving of the Sacrament is the Rite of God's own Appointment, of Confirming to our ſelves all the Benefits of this Covenant, we ſhould then have our People Daily crouding to the Lord's Table, which they do now ſo profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn their Backs upon; we ſhould not then need ſo much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and entreat Perſons to come, but they would of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord Embrace all Opportunities of more and more Enſuring to themſelves theſe moſt invaluable Benefits, by often Coming.</p>
            <p>In a word, A Man is no more fit to partake of the Lord's Supper, that does not well underſtand the Nature and Terms of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which he does therein Ratify and Seal with God; than he is fit to Seal to Covenants and Leaſes, whoſe Conditions and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he never had ſo much as Read over to him, nor does he know them. But Catechizing is the appointed and moſt proper Means of gaining a competent Meaſure of Underſtanding, in the Nature and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40806:15"/> Terms of the Covenant of Grace: Without having been Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized therefore, a Man cannot be well expected to Partake worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>And this is the Second Uſe to which Catechizing does therefore ſerve, to prepare you, that you may be fit and worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Catechizing is Requiſite to Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Edifyed by Preaching.</note> Catechizing is very Uſeful to render you <hi>Capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Edification by the Preaching of the Word, and to your Profiting by Sermons.</hi> That is certainly the true and only edifying Preaching, which does moſt plainly lay open before you, the Meaning, the Reaſons, and the Importance of any Article of your Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may beſt Know God, and the Neceſſity of Serving him; and which does moſt clearly Explain to you the Nature and true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of your Chriſtian Duties, whereby you may Know what it is you have to do, and may be freed from all cauſleſs Doubts and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about the way of your Happineſs: And laſtly, which does give you the moſt convincing Arguments and Reaſons, to move and ſtir you up faithfully to Diſcharge your manifold Obligations to God, your Neighbour, and your Selves. Such as this is truly Edifying Preaching, becauſe this will, if you do duly attend to it, build you up perfect Chriſtians in the Knowledge and Practice of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And now One that has been Catechized, ſo as to have a general Underſtanding in the <hi>Nature of his Covenant;</hi> when ſuch an One hears a Sermon upon any particular Point of that Covenant, whereby he has more fully explain'd to him the Nature and Attributes of God, and his Saviour's Mediation, and of his own Duty, than formerly in Catechizing could be done; and when he hears any good Reaſons and Motives given, whereby he ſhould ſeriouſly apply himſelf to live ſo and ſo, as becomes the Servant of ſuch a God, and ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and One that profeſſes to pay him ſuch Obedience: When a Catechized, Underſtanding Perſon hears ſuch Preaching as this, he finds his Underſtanding more enlightned with Heavenly Truths, and his Will and Affections more bent upon doing as he has been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and ſo (as in all reaſon he ought) he accounts ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon truly Edifying, and himſelf Edify'd thereby.</p>
            <p>But the Ignorant and Uncatechized part of the World, when they hear a Sermon (for want of Diſcretion to judge of its real Worth) ſuch look only at ſome ſuch trifling Conſideration, as the Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and Noiſe of the Speaker; and if there be but enough of that (as generally there is the greateſt Shew, where there is the leaſt of Subſtance) tho' they are made to know no more than they did before of the Importance of any Article of their Faith, or of the Nature and Extent of any Duty of Religion, they are however ſtunn'd into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of they know not what, utterly diſ-regarding the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and really Edifying Preaching, to the very great Prejudice of their Souls, and the utter hinderance of their Improvement by our Miniſtry, in all uſeful and ſubſtantial Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is a mighty Help to the gaining Underſtanding in any Science whatſoever, eſpecially the Chriſtian Religion, to have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral View given one of the whole (which it is the Buſineſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40806:16"/> to do) and to ſee how one Point depends upon another, and do all ſweetly agree together.

And by this a Man ſhall be able alſo to judge whether the Preacher <hi>Builds upon the Foundation, Gold, Silver, precious Stone, or Wood, Hay and Stubble;</hi> and ſhall be able to diſtinguiſh between, and ſeparate the Refuſe and Droſs of a Sermon and Diſcourſe from the weighty and ſubſtantial Parts of it.

            <p>And now, if any of theſe cunning Deceivers ſhould come to any of you, and endeavour to Pervert you, how is it poſſible you ſhould eſcape their Wiles, except you ſhall be well Principled, ſo as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the Foundation Articles of your Religion: But <hi>Holding faſt that form of ſound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13.

Thoſe that agree with this Analogy of Faith, you may be certain are ſound, what do contradict them, you may be ſure are falſe Doctrines. <q>Catechizing is an excellent Means, ſays Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> to keep Perſons from the Errors and the Hereſies of the Times: For Perſons well Catechized and Inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, are in a great meaſure Antidoted againſt the Poiſon of ſeducing Doctrines.

And that excellent Moraliſt, <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his rare Tract of Breeding of Youth, ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, that <hi>As ſoft Wax is apt to take the Stamp of the Seal, ſo are the Minds of Children to receive in Inſtructions imprinted on them at that Age.</hi> Let but your Youth be taught ſo much as they are capable to learn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of God, how that he is wonderfully Good to thoſe that Love and Fear him, and that he will be Terrible in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards thoſe that Diſobey him. Let them be inſtructed how wonderfully Kind the Son of God was to them, as to come down himſelf from Heaven to call them forth out of the wicked World (wholly given up to the Service of the Devil) to ſerve their God and Maker. Let them be taught betimes, as much as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to underſtand of this, and of their Duty to God and Man, and what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe and Profeſſion they have made in their Baptiſm, not willingly to offend ſo good and gracious a Saviour, but to ſerve and honour him for ever: Let but theſe Notions take the firſt Poſſeſſion of your Minds, and it will be hardly poſſible for any Temptation to prevail over you, and to draw you into Sin; you will then Bluſh to hear the lewd and fooliſh Talk of the Godleſs Crew of hardned Sinners, you will then Tremble at their bold Oaths; and you will be out of Countenance to be ſo much as Seen in the Company of Drunkards. If they ſhall endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to joyn with them in their lewd Courſes, you will have That within you will quickly anſwer, I cannot, I dare not do ſo ill a Thing: I cannot be guilty of ſo great a Piece of Ingratitude, as to offend ſo good a God, and gracious a Saviour as mine: I dare not be guilty of ſo high an Injuſtice, as to violate my Covenant, Vow and Promiſe to him, for then he will eternally Puniſh me: <hi>Away all ye workers of Iniquity, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Youth untaught and unnurtured, quickly fly out into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Extravagances; for why? they know no better, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no good Principles that ſhould controul them. Vanity, Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts, and their wicked Companions hurry them into ſuch bold Villanies, as make us admire the Patience of God, that forbears ſtriking them quick into Hell, but on they go to provoke him to the utmoſt; and how ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſince they have no Notion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40806:17"/> of the difference between Good and Evil: Nor any Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, that ſhould in the leaſt check them in the Purſuit of that which is Evil, and ſtir them up to that which is Good.</p>
            <p>True it is, It may too often happen, that One that has laid up in ſtore a good Foundation of Religious Principles, may be tempted, and much ſtaggered in his Conſtancy, and perhaps be overtaken in a Fault, ſo as wilfully to do an ill Thing. But then obſerve the force of Religious Principles: Such a One will ſoon bethink himſelf what he has done, his Conſcience will quickly ſmite him, and he will be immediately brought to Repentance (through the Power of good Principles) and his Fall will but make him more careful of his ways hereafter.</p>
            <p>Nay, It may ſometimes happen, that a very towardly Youth (notwithſtanding all the care of his Parents and Chriſt's Miniſters to bring him up in the <hi>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</hi>) when got too ſoon from under the Eye of his Parents and wiſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and falling into lewd Company (with which this Age does too much abound) may at firſt be a little Laught out of Countenance by them, (as is their wont) for being too Preciſe, Reſerv'd, and Melancholly; and after that be drawn by degrees into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance after another with them in their Ungodly Revels: Nay, and at length be ſo drencht in Sin, as to deface the whole Image of God, that was wrought upon his Soul, ſo as to be even paſt all hopes of Recovery.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> To Recover out of it when fallen therein</note>But even in this caſe, Secondly, The Power of thoſe good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that were early Sown, ſhall be wonderfully ſeen to the Glory of God, and the Praiſe of good Education. Let Diſeaſes, Diſtreſſes, Poverty, or any ſore Affliction befal a lewd and ſorry Liver (as generally, ſooner or later it does) either as the Fruit of their Sin, or as a Chaſtiſement from God to reclaim them. If the Perſon afflicted has been One that was never Inſtructed in the Fear of God, he is never the better, nor ſhall you hear ſo much as a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from him, nor any the leaſt Signs of Amendment; for why? He Knows not what he is to do, nor where he is to begin, nor does he diſtinctly know any good Reaſon wherefore he ought to Amend; for Thanks to the Piety of his good Parents, he never had any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Good inſtill'd into him; and therefore as all his Life time he Liv'd like an Atheiſt, ſo he now does Die like a Beaſt: He was ignorantly brought up, and he Dies ignorant and wicked both.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhall happen, that One who had receiv'd the Seed of good Principles within him, be overtaken with ſome ſore Affliction, and God be ſo gracious to him, as not to cut him off quickly in the midſt of his Sins, but affords him a leiſurely Chaſtiſement; ſuch a One ſhall begin to be ſerious and to bethink himſelf. He will recal to Mind what he once knew of God, and of his Duty to him. Thoſe good Principles that have long lain Buried under a Load of Sin, will begin to ſtir within him. He will water them ſufficiently with Tears of Repentance, and they will begin to work and revive within. And when he is once come to himſelf, ſo as to think ſeriouſly of Matters, with the Prodigal Son he will ſoon reſolve to <hi>Ariſe and go to his Father, and to ſay unto him, Father I have Sinn'd againſt Heaven,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40806:17"/> and before Thee; and am no more worthy to be call'd thy Son, make me as One of thy hired Servants,</hi> Luk. 15.18, 19. The Seed of good and religious Principles ſown in your Hearts by Catechetical Inſtruction, may well be compared to Seed, ſown in the Ground by the Hand of the Husbandman. The Husbandman's Seed may lie Buried in the Earth under many Clods, ſo as to be in danger never to recover, but if the Rains ſhall deſcend from Heaven, ſo as to melt and diſſolve that burden of Earth, with which the Seed was overlaid, it will then begin to work and revive, if it was good Seed, and may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring forth a very fruitful Crop. So here, if you do but take care to have the Seed of good Principles ſown in your Hearts, and ſhould ye afterwards almoſt extinguiſh all good Motions within you, by laying on a continued Weight of Guilt and Sin; and ſhould God in Mercy hereafter; not pour down the Fury of his Wrath, ſo as immediately to Deſtroy you, but Rain down upon you the gentle Showers of Fatherly Chaſtiſements, ſo as to melt you into Tears, and bring you into a conſidering Temper; the good Principles that lay long Buried, may poſſibly begin to ſtir, and to work in you a Repentance fruitful in good Works.</p>
            <p>Nay, Such is the Force of good Principles, that even a ſerious Sermon, or but the Diſcourſe of a good Miniſter (eſpecially of him, who firſt ſowed them by his Inſtructions) ſhall ſtir them up, and put them a working, to the Converſion and Reformation of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>In a word: Such is the Effect of good Principles, that by the Grace of God, they are the likelieſt way to preſerve you in Innocency, and to prevent your falling into any deadly Sin, and then you will be in a happy Condition; you will then be of the Number of thoſe happy Perſons, of whom our Saviour ſpeaks, that they <hi>need no Repentance, Luk.</hi> 15.7. that is, ſuch a ſevere, and ſorrowful, and painful Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as Backſliding Sinners, and all Men of looſe and wicked Lives muſt go through, or be forced to Endure infinitely worſe: Or if you ſhall unhappily fall into any grievous Sin, or a Courſe of Sin, ſuch may be the Force of pious Education, or good Principles, as by God's good Grace and Providence, to recover you out of the Snares of the Devil. Theſe good Principles taught you in your Catechiſm, may not perhaps at preſent be throughly underſtood by you, no more than Children do the uſe of Letters, nor School-boys the uſe of Grammar Rules at firſt, but they will ſtick by you (as One ſaid) and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred when you are more capable of Improving them, inſomuch that it will be uneaſy to you, if you take care to be well Principled in your Minority, to be Wicked and Profane hereafter; or if you ſhould prove ſo (which God forbid) there will yet be ſome hopes of Reclaiming you, becauſe theſe things will ſome time or other revive and awaken your Conſciences.</p>
            <p>And this is the laſt of thoſe good Uſes and Ends, to which Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm ſerves; <hi>(viz.)</hi> to Inſtil into you ſuch good Principles, as will either prevent your falling into Sin, (which is much the Happier for you) or at leaſt recover you out of it by Repentance; and which I have therefore inſiſted on, that I might perſwade you to have a due Regard to ſo uſeful an Inſtruction, as Catechizing is, and to give a due Attendance to it.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40806:18"/>
            <p>And thus, as laſt Lord's Day I ſhewed you, that one good End to which Catechizing ſerves, is to prepare you for that neceſſary Work, your Confirmation, that you may Publickly, and with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as thoſe that know what they do) profeſs before the Biſhop, That you will be Faithful to your Baptiſmal Covenant: So Secondly, I have to Day ſhewed you, That it is for the ſame Reaſon requiſite to prepare you for Receiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament, both by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing you in the Covenant of Grace, which in the Sacrament we Seal, and in the Meaning of the Sacrament it ſelf, that it is the Rite of Sealing it. Thirdly, I have now ſhewed you, that Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is very Uſeful to render you underſtanding Hearers of the Word, when it is Preacht, ſo as you may receive Edification by it, and may be Profited by Sermons. Fourthly, That it is requiſite to ſecure you from being at any time miſ-led into dangerous Hereſies and Errors, by the Sermons and Diſcourſes of Men, crafty to Deceive, to the Peril of your immortal Souls. And Laſtly, I have now largely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that it is exceeding Uſeful to preſerve you from falling into any groſs and waſting Sin, and eſpecially any ungodly Courſe of Living; or if any of you ſhall hereafter be Seduced (which God forbid) by evil Company, that the having the Seed of good Principles ſown in the Heart by a timely Catechizing, will be the moſt likely Means to recover you out of the Snares of the Devil.</p>

               <hi>THE Third Lecture. <hi>What is your Name?</hi>
               </hi> And the Anſwer is made by the Chriſtian Name.</head>
            <p>IN Two Diſcourſes, on the Title of your Catechiſm, having given you to underſtand what a Catechiſm means, and ſhewed you alſo the Ends and Uſes of Catechizing; I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by God's Aſſiſtance to Explain the Catechiſm it ſelf, and to give you the Meaning of its ſeveral Parts. And the firſt Thing that offers it ſelf to our Conſideration, is the firſt Queſtion in your Catechiſm, <hi>(viz.) What is your Name?</hi> And the Anſwer you are taught to make to it, which is your <hi>Chriſtian Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Queſtion is not ſo idle and inſignificant, as ſome may imagine, but is ask'd upon very good Reaſons; inſomuch that I do think, they may give me a very fair Occaſion, to diſcourſe to you upon theſe Three Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſhew you, that the Reaſon wherefore your Catechiſm begins with Asking you, What is your Chriſtian Name? Is to put you in Mind of your Chriſtian Profeſſion, and of that ſtrictneſs of Life, that is anſwerable thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They do give me occaſion to Re-mind you, that the bad Lives of ſuch who bear the Name of Chriſtians, do an infinite Prejudice and Diſ-honour to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, To exhort you therefore to ſtand upon the Dignity of your Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, by living ſuch good Lives, as may be an Honour, not a Diſgrace unto it.</p>
            <p>And theſe Three Heads of Diſcourſe, as they do naturally ariſe from this Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, ſo I know not any thing can be more properly and ſeaſonably Diſcours'd upon in the Entrance upon your Catechiſm, as tending to warn you before-hand to Apply every thing you ſhall hereafter hear, either in the Catechiſm it ſelf, or in the Explication thereof, to the Better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Lives and Practices. To begin then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am to ſhew you, that the Reaſon wherefore your Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm begins with Asking you, What is your Chriſtian Name? Is to put you in Mind of your Chriſtian Profeſſion, and of that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, that is Anſwerable thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is thought ſufficient to juſtify this Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name (tho' there were no great Matter imply'd in its meaning) that it is the Beginning of a Dialogue, it being the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40806:19"/> uſual manner of Dialogues, or mutual Diſcourſes, managed between ſeveral Perſons, (be the Subject of them never ſo grave and ſerious) not to fall immediately Point-blank upon the main Matter intended, but in ſuch, they uſually uſher in the more material Points, by ſuch familiar Queſtions as this.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt on this, and many other good Reaſons, that might be given; tho' there be great Familiarity and Condeſcenſion in the Queſtion, yet it is not without good Reaſon and Conſideration, that in the Entrance of this Inſtruction in your Chriſtian Religion, you ſhould be firſt ask'd your Chriſtian Name.<note place="margin">The reaſon wherefore the Catechiſm begins with Asking the Catechumen his Chriſtian Name, is to put him in mind of his Chriſtian Profeſſion.</note> And the great Reaſon is, That at the Mention thereof, you might be prompted to call to Mind what Religion and Profeſſion you are of. You had your Chriſtian Names given you, at the ſame time you took upon you the Chriſtian Profeſſion; you are therefore in the firſt Entrance of your Catechiſm (which is an Inſtruction of you in this your Chriſtian Profeſſion) Ask'd, What is your Chriſtian Name? That you might call to Mind that moſt excellent Religion you received together with it, and under that Name ſolemnly Promiſed and Vowed, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cleave unto.</p>
            <p>Your Sir-name you have derived down unto you from your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and you receiv'd it from your Natural Parents: But your Chriſtian Name you received immediately from the Mouths of your Spiritual Parents, your Miniſter, and your Godfathers, who as your Proxies, did at the ſame time, they gave you a Chriſtian Name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for you, that you ſhould live a Chriſtian Life, Holy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, as becomes thoſe, who bear ſo Glorious a Title. You muſt therefore conſider what your Name is, and the Importance of it, that it is Chriſtian, and you muſt take care, that you Live not ſo, as to bring a Scandal upon that Name, in any Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ſo, as becomes thoſe, who profeſs Chriſtianity, and wear the Name of Chriſtians, <hi>In Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the Days of your Lives.</hi> And as he, who hath called you, is Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Force there is in a Chriſtian name to make a Man lead a Chriſtian life as under that Name hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liſted himſelf.</note>And there is indeed the greateſt Force in our very Chriſtian Names, to render us Conformable to the Chriſtian Doctrine, and whereby we may be perſwaded to live Chriſtian-like, otherwiſe the Apoſtle would not have laid ſo much ſtreſs upon our very Name and Profeſſion of Chriſtians, as he does, to perſwade us from that very Reaſon to live Holy and Chriſtian Lives. <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt,</hi> or upon whom the Name of Chriſt is called, <hi>depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. For why? It is ever expected, that thoſe, that profeſs to be guided by the perfecteſt Doctrines, ſhould anſwerably live the moſt perfect Lives. The Heathens did therefore expect,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> A Diſciple of a moſt Holy and excellent Religion.</note> that their Philoſophers, who gave the higheſt Principles and Rules of Morality, ſhould themſelves exceed all others in a vertuous and orderly Courſe of Life; and when they found any of their Philoſophers a Tripping, and living at the rate of other Men of looſer Principles, how ſeverely therefore would they Reflect upon them for it? Now we Chriſtians profeſs our ſelves the Diſciples of a <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that does infinitely exceed all others in the Powerfulneſs of its Principles and Doctrines, and in the Holineſs and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40806:19"/> Strictneſs of its Commands. We have given up our Names,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> A Servant of a moſt Holy and Juſt God.</note> and Liſted our ſelves to be the Souldiers and Servants, not of a Lewd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Wanton <hi>Venus,</hi> a Fiery <hi>Mars,</hi> a Revengeful <hi>Juno,</hi> a Drunken <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and a Thieviſh <hi>Mercury:</hi> Such were the Heathen Gods, and no wonder then, that they who did Worſhip them, ſhould alſo Imitate them. But we have given up our Names and Liſted our ſelves the Servants of <hi>A God, that hath no pleaſure in Wickedneſs, neither ſhall any Evil dwell with him; in whoſe ſight the Fooliſh ſhall not ſtand, and who hateth all the workers of Iniquity; who will deſtroy all men that ſpeak leaſing</hi> (that are crafty to Cheat and Deceive) <hi>and will abhor the blood-thirſty and deceitful man,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5, 6. Nay, <hi>Who will rain upon the Wicked, Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their Cup, for the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, his Countenance doth behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> Pſal. 11.6, 7.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> To fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</note> Such is the God to whom we have given up our Names to ſerve: And we have Liſted our ſelves in our Baptiſm, under our ſeveral Chriſtian Names, to fight under his Banner againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, ſo as not to be tempted or drawn off to commit any Injuſtice, or Unmercifulneſs, any Intemperance, or Filthineſs, any Act of Ungodlineſs, or Profaneneſs: In a word, any Sin againſt him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> As under that Name he profeſſes to Believe ſuch Articles as are the moſt powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> We have Engaged our ſelves under our ſeveral Names in the ſtrongeſt Covenants, in hopes of the moſt glorious Rewards, and out of fear of the ſoreſt Puniſhments, to be Faithful in our Obedience to him. We have openly Profeſt under our reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Chriſtian Names, firmly to Believe ſuch a Set of Articles (thoſe of our Chriſtian Faith) as are every one of them (as ſhall hereafter be made appear) the moſt powerful Motives in the World, to make us <hi>Deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and Godly in this preſent evil World.</hi> And under the ſame Chriſtian Names we have all of us profeſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> To Obey the moſt Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws.</note> To be Governed by ſuch Laws and Commands of Vertue and Goodneſs, of Piety towards God, of Righteouſneſs to our Neighbours, and which lay down ſuch incomparable Rules concerning the Government of our ſelves, as the like are not to be found in any other <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> And Laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, As having under that Name received Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of moſt powerful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances to do all this.</note> We profeſs to have ſuch Aſſiſtances derived to us from God, by Prayer and Sacraments (thoſe Means of his own Appointment to convey down his Aid and Aſſiſtance to us, to Enable us to do theſe Things) as will make it not extreamly difficult to us, to live very excellent and good Lives.</p>
            <p>Thus have we Chriſtians under our ſeveral Chriſtian Names (as under Hand and Seal) profeſt our ſelves the Diſciples of a Religion, that does infinitely exceed all others in the Powerfulneſs of its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines, and the Holineſs and Strictneſs of its Precepts and Rules: Of a Religion, that can work, if its Dictates be follow'd, the greateſt Miracles in the changing Men's Natures and Tempers from worſe to better; that can turn a ravenous <hi>Wolf</hi> into a harmleſs <hi>Lamb,</hi> a furious <hi>Lion</hi> into a tender <hi>Kid;</hi> that is, the moſt ſavage and violent Diſpoſitions of Cruelty and Pride, into perfect Charity and Meekneſs. And now, if we Chriſtians ſhould be found as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and Evil Livers, as Unconverted Heathens, as Lewd as Turks, as Griping as Jews, as Impious and Profane as Atheiſts, how ſeverely, and that deſervedly, will the reſt of the Infidel World
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40806:20"/> Upbraid us? What Diſhonour ſhall we thereby do to the true God, and our moſt Holy Religion?</p>
            <p>Which brings me to the Second Thing propos'd, which was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that the Bad Lives of thoſe who bear the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, do an infinite Prejudice and Diſ-honour to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The bad lives of Nominal Chriſtians do an infinite Prejudice &amp; Diſhonour to to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>And alas! What bitter Reproaches have the Unchriſtian Lives of Chriſtian Profeſſors, put into the Mouths of our Enemies, making them to ſay, that if we Chriſtians, did but Believe our ſelves, thoſe Promiſes in Scripture, of ſuch mighty Rewards to Holy, Honeſt and Good Living, we ſhould ſure our ſelves live better Lives: And when any of our Chriſtians would perſwade them to forſake their own Superſtition and Idolatry, and to Embrace our moſt Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, our Unanſwerable Lives have provok'd them to return ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough upon us, Would you have us to Believe the Truth of your Religion, which you do not ſeem to Believe your ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It hinders the Converſion of Infidels.</note>And alas! This is the main Thing, the very Unſuitable Lives of us Chriſtians, that ſo Prejudices the Infidel Part of the World, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Turks, and Jews againſt our moſt Holy Religion, and hinders their Converſion. It is the Cruelty, and Covetouſneſs of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Merchants in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that makes the poor <hi>Indians</hi> even Abhor our Religion, and Scornfully to ſay, That Gold, not <hi>Jehovah</hi> is our God. Thus <hi>Is the Name of God Blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles through us,</hi> Rom. 2.24. It is the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes Turks and Jews (both of them mortal Haters of Idols) to loath and deſpiſe the Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It puts bitter Reproaches in the Mouth of Atheiſts, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when Wickedneſs is commited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>But not to Travel ſo far, as the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> to find out how much our Living ſo unbecoming our moſt Holy Profeſſion, has ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd Perſons, ſo as to Abhor it; Obſerve the Men of No Religion amongſt our ſelves, our Atheiſts and Libertines, and what bitter Scoffs and Jeers may we daily hear them caſt forth upon Religion it ſelf, when they ſee ſome, that make great outward Profeſſions there, guilty of ſo much Hypocriſy, Cheating, Cruelty, and Rebellion; making their very Religion, a Cloak for the carrying on the moſt wicked Things, as if the leaſt Religious, the moſt honeſt Man. And now, if there were but the leaſt ſpark of Love and Honour in our Hearts for God and our moſt Holy Religion, this were enough to make us careful to lead innocent and inoffenſive Lives, if it were only that we might not diſhonour God and Religion thereby, and might not bring a Reproach upon our Chriſtian Name. Every Man that deſires the Honour and Reputation of his Calling and Profeſſion whatever it is, will live anſwerable to his Character, and not ſo, as to be a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to his Place.<note place="margin">Few Men will endure their worldly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be put at naught and Reproacht.</note> And therefore, as we ſeldom ſee a Perſon of ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and mean a Spirit, as to endure with Patience, whatever Art, or Profeſſion he is of, to be ſet at naught and ſpoke againſt; ſo Men are generally, with reſpect to the Credit of their worldly Profeſſions, careful to act with that Decency and Becomingneſs, as ſhall advance, the Reputation thereof. Hence the Lawyer, as he cannot ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily (endure except he be a profligate Perſon) his Profeſſion of the Law, nor the Phyſician his, nor the Tradeſman his, to be run down, Expoſed and made Ridiculous; ſo each of theſe will be, as much as poſſible, for maintaining in their ſeveral Dealings a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Fairneſs and Honeſty, as that alone which will raiſe and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40806:20"/> preſerve an Eſteem for them. And how then comes it about that a Chriſtian can endure to hear his Chriſtian Profeſſion reproach'd and ſcorn'd by reaſon of his ſcandalous Living? Whence is it, but from the greater Zeal Men generally have for the Honour of their worldly Callings and Profeſſions, than for the Honour of their Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Profeſſion and Calling?</p>
            <p>And now therefore Thirdly, Let me Exhort you,<note place="margin">An Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore to Chriſtians to ſtand upon the Dignity of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Name and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to ſtand upon the Dignity of your Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, by living ſuch good Lives, as may be an Honour, not a Diſgrace unto it: Let me therefore Admoniſh you from this very Name, wherewith you are Honoured, to render your ſelves wholly conformable to thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles and Doctrines to which you have given up your Names to be governed by, and which being taught you in your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, I ſhall by God's leave, with all the Plainneſs, and in the moſt Uſeful manner I can explain unto you.</p>
            <p>And pray let me Entreat you my Dear Youth, ſeriouſly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to hearken to me your Spiritual Father, that ſtudies no leſs the Eternal Intereſt of your Souls, and to make you Heirs of Heaven, than your Natural Parents do your Temporal Intereſt to gather you Riches, and to leave you Eſtates in this World. You have been Ask'd, and you have Anſwer'd to your Chriſtian Name; and you ſee with what Title you are dignify'd, <hi>(viz.)</hi> with the Name of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Wonder not at what I ſay, thoſe Titles of Honour, which we daily hear ſounding in our Ears,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> As that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> and which are ſo much admired and doted upon; I mean the Titles of Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Lords, ought to be accounted as very inconſiderable in reſpect of our Chriſtian Title. They are but Earthly Glories, and will ſoon decay and vaniſh away, but this is of a Divine Original, which will never fade, but will Ennoble you to all Eternity. I beſeech you therefore ſeriouſly conſider this, and let a due Honour and Regard to ſo worthy a Name, continually Admoniſh every one of you, that you never commit in your whole Lives, any thing that does unbecome it.</p>
            <p>I do alſo, Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Becauſe of that near Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance there is between the Chriſtian Name, and Profeſſion.</note> Entreat every One of you to conſider the near Alliance there is betwixt your Chriſtian Names, and your Chriſtian Profeſſion, inſomuch that they both began, and will both end toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In your Baptiſm you put on both your Name and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity together, and if ever you ſhould abjure your Religion (which God forbid) you muſt alſo therewith abjure your Chriſtian Names, ſo near are they linkt one with another. And therefore let this ever admoniſh you to Adorn your ſelves with Chriſtian Graces, Temperance, Chaſtity, Charity, Juſtice, Piety; and not to defile your ſelves with Heatheniſh, Brutiſh Vices, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Cruelty, Infidelity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Becauſe the primitive Chriſtians did in vertue of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Name reſiſt the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> And is it Examples of this good Uſe of your Chriſtian Name, that you want? Why the Chriſtians of Old took Courage from this very Name, whereby they overcame all their Enemies, both Bodily and Ghoſtly, the World, the Fleſh and the Devil; and encourag'd themſelves thereby to the Diſcharge of their Chriſtian Duties. In the Vertue of this Name they extinguiſht their Luſts, they overcame Tyrants, they put to flight the Devil. Their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors with Fire and Fagot, and all manner of cruel Torments, would have them forc'd them to Blaſpheme Chriſt, to ſacrifice and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40806:21"/> burn Incenſe to Devils, to worſhip Idols. But they in the midſt of Flames and Torments would anſwer with Smiles on their Faces, We are Chriſtians, we cannot do theſe Things. Forbear your Aſſemblies and Church-meetings, would the Heathen Perſecutors ſay; We are Chriſtians, and muſt not therefore <hi>Forſake the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves together,</hi> would they anſwer. Such great things did the Primitive Chriſtians perform under the Power of the Chriſtian Name. And let your very Chriſtian Names likewiſe, my Chriſtian Youth, encourage you to all manner of Vertuous and Religious Practices, in imitation of thoſe Bleſſed Primitive Chriſtians, and to the Examples of thoſe, that ſhall come after you.</p>

                  <hi>IV.</hi> Becauſe of the Indecency of Living unſuitable to the Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion.</note>Nay Fourthly, Look upon it ever as a moſt monſtrous piece of Wickedneſs, for Chriſtian Men, to live Antichriſtian Heatheniſh Lives, but on the contrary, ever look upon your ſelves, as you are Chriſtians, bound even in Decency to <hi>Abſtain from all Appearances of Evil,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.22. What ſhall you, that have given up your Names to Chriſt, and are in Covenant with God, fight the Devil's Battels? <hi>Know you not that your Bodies are the Members of Chriſt, and ſhall you take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot? God forbid,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. Shall you that are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, walk in Darkneſs? Have you Renounced the Devil, the World and the Fleſh, and you for all that yield your ſelves Slaves to the Devil, the World and the Fleſh? You Believe the Goſpel, and all the Articles of your Chriſtian Faith, and ſhall any of you live as thoſe, that neither know, nor fear God, nor dread the Devil?

And now, my young Diſciple, ſearch the Scripture, and other Hiſtories, who, or what, He, or She was, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40806:21"/> wherein thy Name-ſake did Excel in any Goodneſs; and propoſe ſuch a One for thy particular Example, to whoſe Eminency in the like Vertue, do thou all thou canſt to arrive. Do thou <hi>John</hi> bethink thy ſelf often of that great Contempt of the World, that One of thy Name, <hi>(viz.) John</hi> the Baptiſt did ſhew, and of that burning Love to God and Men, which the other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Apoſtle of that Name did expreſs, and let the One excite thee likewiſe to the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, and the other to the like Love of God and Men. A <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould do well to call to Mind the ready Confeſſion of Chriſt, that the Apoſtle of that Name did make, and the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſorrowfulneſs of his Repentance, after he had Sinn'd, and let the Thoughts of him make thee ready to give Teſtimony to the Truth and Faith of Chriſt, and put thee upon a ſpeedy Repentance, after every fall and backſliding into Sin.</p>
            <p>Let every <hi>Anne</hi> call to Mind that Widow of her Name, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Luk</hi> 2.37. <hi>Who though a Widow of fourſcore Years and four, departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſting and Prayers, night and day.</hi> And let the Example of this devout and happy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of thy Name, call thee <hi>Anne</hi> to the firſt beginning of Prayers, Sacraments, and Sermons.

            <p>Laſtly, Let me give it in Charge to you, that are Parents,<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Parents are Advis'd to chooſe for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Names of Perſons Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, not Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Vice.</note> not to give to your Children any other Names, but what are of Note for their eminent and good Examples, that they may have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes whom they may Imitate in their Vertue. Give them ſuch Names, as if not Signalized in Scripture, are at leaſt in other Hiſtories for ſome Good they have done: Or if you give them the Names of any of your Anceſtors, let it be of thoſe, whoſe Vertues have adorn'd, not whoſe Vices have diſgrace'd the Age, they liv'd in: Or of ſuch who have left behind them a good Name to be Imitated, nothing Ill to be Abominated by their Poſterity, for thoſe only are worthy to have their Memory continued in the Names of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, but theſe are fit to be Eternally forgot.</p>
            <p>And thus, my Chriſtian Diſciples, having ſhew'd you the great, the very great Obligation lying upon you, even from your Chriſtian Names, to ſquare your Lives according to the Chriſtian Rules, thoſe Rules, that you have taught you, and ſhall hereafter with God's Aſſiſtance, be explain'd to you in the Expoſition, I ſhall give you of your Catechiſm: And from ſeveral Conſiderations having therefore urg'd you, to live with all the Care you can, according to that moſt holy Religion, to which in your Baptiſm you have given up your Names, and under your ſeveral Names have Liſted your ſelves to maintain and cleave unto: What then remains, my Chriſtian Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but that you apply your ſelves with the greateſt Diligence, in order to your living good Lives, to underſtand throughly that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Who gave you that Name?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptiſm, wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They did promiſe and vow three things in my Name, Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. Secondly, That I ſhould Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. And Thirdly, That I ſhould keep God's holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of my Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Doſt thou not think that thou art bound to believe, and to do, as they have promiſed for thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily, and by God's help ſo I will. And I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this State of Salvation, through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour. And I pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my Lives end.</p>
            <p>AS the Compilers of the Catechiſm did very wiſely begin with a Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, to the End, that at the mention thereof, you might take occaſion to conſider the great Obligation, which lies upon you to live according to that moſt Holy Religion, which under that Name you have received; ſo in Commenting upon that Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, I have given you my ſelf ſome preparatory Admonitions, accordingly to make that good Uſe of thoſe Inſtructions, ſhall be given you from your Catechiſm, as to live ſuitably to them.</p>
            <p>And being thus well prepar'd, I hope, to receive Benefit from what ſhall hereafter be deliver'd; what remains, but that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Inſtruct you in all the Material Parts of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to the Belief and Practice of which you have given up your Names? This, by the Aſſiſtance of God, I ſhall endeavour to do, (and I beg your Prayers to obtain his Aſſiſtance) and in the ſame
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40806:23"/> Method your Catechiſm teaches you;<note place="margin">Our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm gives an entire In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Covenant of Grace, both generally and particularly.</note> and I am ſure I cannot chooſe a better to do it in; ſince whatſoever is neceſſary to be Believ'd and Practis'd in order to Salvation, you have therein taught you both generally, and particularly.</p>
            <p>As to a more General Inſtitution, you have the ſumm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chriſtian Religion, and whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation taught you that way, in thoſe Three Queſtions and Anſwers, which I have now read to you. The ſumm and ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Generally in the <hi>3</hi> First Queſtions and Anſwers.</note> and whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contain'd within the Covenant of Grace; for undoubtedly there can be nothing more of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation, than what God himſelf has been pleas'd to Promiſe and Enſure unto us, and we our ſelves have Engag'd to perform. And now in theſe Three Queſtions and Anſwers now read to you,</p>
            <p>Firſt, You have whatſoever pertains to the Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace expreſly deliver'd. I will inſtance to you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which pertain to the Nature of it, and will point to the Words wherein they are taught.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place you are Inſtructed, what are the Terms and Conditions whereof it conſiſts, both on God's Part, and on Ours, in theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which are the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Favours made over to us on God's Part of the Covenant; and in theſe, <hi>Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. Secondly, That I ſhould Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. And Thirdly, That I ſhould keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of my Life,</hi> which are the Conditions to be perform'd on our Part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have here taught you the Gracious Importance of this Covenant, we are put thereby into <hi>A State of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have an Account of the Original of it, and by whoſe Mediation, you obtain'd ſo Beneficial and Gracious a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, taught you in theſe Words; <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> It was through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, that we obtain'd the Benefit of ſo Gracious a Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You are Inſtructed by whom, and how you have been call'd into this State of Salvation, by Means of the Covenant of Grace. It was your <hi>Heavenly Father, who hath call'd you to this State of Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Laſtly, You are Admoniſht of the very great reaſon you have to thank God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo exceeding great a Mercy, as his Calling you into it. <hi>And I thank God our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he hath call'd me to this State of Salvation, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Thus far you are Inſtructed concerning what pertains to the Nature of the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">II. You have alſo declar'd unto you, by what Sacrament, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity you firſt enter'd into it. It was in your <hi>Baptiſm, wherein you was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">III. You have then thoſe vaſt Obligations lying upon you, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Conſcientiouſly to diſcharge your part of the Covenant laid
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40806:23"/> plainly before you. This you own in your Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Doſt thou not think, that thou art bound to Believe, and to Do as they have promis'd for thee?</hi> To which you are taught to Anſwer, <hi>Yes verily ſo I will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. You have farther yet, the Means whereby you ſhall be enabled to perform your Part of the Covenant. The Firſt, is the Grace, Help and Aſſiſtance of God. <hi>And by God's Help ſo I will.</hi> The Second Means, both to obtain the Divine Aſſiſtance, and to enable you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcharge your Covenant, is Prayer unto God. <hi>And I Pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my Lives end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Laſtly, You have alſo Intimated herein, Two material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, relating to the making of this Covenant betwixt God and You, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The time of Infancy, wherein you enter'd into it, imply'd in theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made.</hi> 2. The Perſons by whom, as <hi>Proxies,</hi> you were Initiated therein. <hi>My Godfathers and Godmothers did promiſe and vow three Things in my Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will endeavour to Explain all theſe Points unto you, in this Firſt and General Part, according as they are here taught you in theſe Queſtions and Anſwers now read, as the Text, beginning</p>
            <p>Firſt, With what pertains to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>And in order to the Underſtanding hereof, it may not be amiſs to premiſe ſomething concerning the more general Notion of ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, as are uſually made betwixt Governours, and their Subjects. And ſuch an One, if it be perfect in all its Parts, and fully expreſt, may be defin'd to be</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An Agreement between the Two Parties, wherein there are Promiſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Notion of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
               <hi>Rewards, or profitable Conſiderations made over on one Part, and certain Conditions to be perform'd on the other. And wherein alſo, there is an Obligation on the one ſide, of undergoing ſome certain Penalties, in caſe of not performing thoſe Conditions conſented unto by him, and impos'd on him by the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Covenant,</hi> I ſay, <hi>is a mutual Agreement between Two Parties;</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for if it be not mutual, and both Parties are not conſenting to the Terms, the One to the making good the Promiſes, the Other to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conditions, the Agreement is none at all, or it is not Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor is it Obliging on either ſide. There may be indeed a Law given by one that is Superior in Power and Authority, which the Inferior is bound to Obey, whether he conſent, or no, becauſe he is plac'd by the Divine Ordinance, under the Other's Command, and if he does refuſe to Obey, he may be juſtly Puniſht; but then ſuch a Tranſaction is to be conſider'd as the giving of a Law, not as the making of a Covenant. Nor is this a ſlight Difference; for where a Superior has given a Law, if the Inferior has alſo Covenanted, and conſented upon good Conſiderations, and upon the Expectation of promis'd Rewards to obey that Law; ſuch a Covenant does withal lay a farther Obligation on the Party, on whom the Conditions ly to be perform'd, by vertue of his own Conſent, to do it; ſo that in the Violation of his Duty, in ſuch a caſe, he ſhall be accounted, not barely Diſobedient, but a <hi>Covenant-breaker,</hi> which is added as a more aggravated Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. and therefore deſerving a more ſevere Puniſhment.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40806:24"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">As there are Conditions therein on our ſide, ſo expreſs Promiſes on the other.</note>It was farther added in the Definition, That <hi>in a Covenant there are certain Promiſes, Rewards, and profitable Conſiderations made over on one Part, on certain Conditions to be perform'd on the other.</hi> And herein alſo, with reſpect to theſe Promiſes, there ſeems to be another main Difference betwixt the Impoſing of the Law, and the Making of a Covenant. The Difference ſeems to be in this, That in the Impoſing of a Law, the Law-giver does not neceſſarily oblige himſelf to confer any Benefits, more than natural Equity does oblige him to, and it is ſufficient to the Validity of his Law to render it Obligatory, if there be a Threatning of Puniſhments, great enough to deter the Subject from the Violation of that Law. But a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> does imply ſomething more comfortable in the Notion of it, and therein the Party covenanting, tho' it be God himſelf, does graciouſly Condeſcend to oblige and bind himſelf, by expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (and uſually by ſome outward Solemnities, as viſible Signs and Seals) to the performance of ſuch Promiſes. And here alſo is another very conſiderable Difference betwixt the Obligations of a Law and a Covenant, that whereas on performance of Obedience to the Laws of a Superior, the Subject upon ſuch his Obedience, can have only, by vertue of the Law, ſome general and faint Hopes of Benefit, ſo far as is Equitable, and as thoſe who do well, may expect to receive well. But, by vertue of a Covenant, the Party promiſing has moreover given to the other, a full aſſurance of certain Benefits to be made good to him; inſomuch that upon our Repentance and <hi>Confeſſion of our Sins, God will reckon himſelf in Juſtice and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bound</hi> (ſince the giving of the new Covenant) <hi>to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. So that in ſhort, A Covenant lays a greater Obligation, than the meer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of a Law does, upon both the Parties joyn'd in Covenant; a greater Obligation, I ſay, upon the One, to perform the Conditions, upon the Other, to make good the Promiſes. And let this ſuffice to have remark'd upon the more general Notion and Nature of a Covenant.</p>

And thus he broke his Covenant with God, Sinn'd againſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and ſo forfeited all the Happineſs, convey'd to him therein, both for himſelf, and his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And now was Man in a deſperate and forlorn Condition: His own Sin had made him liable to the ſevereſt Strokes of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; and the Divine Juſtice, and Wiſdom,<note place="margin">The Divine Juſtice Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs requir'd ſatisfaction.</note> and Holineſs would not permit the Almighty (however his Goodneſs inclin'd him to Pity) to let his Sin go unpuniſht, and to reſtore him to a capacity of Happineſs, without a valuable <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to infinite Juſtice, ſuch as ſhould ſhew the Divine hatred of, and ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, for the ſecurity of his Government in the World: And yet no Creature in the Heavens above, or in the Earth beneath, was ſufficient for ſo great an Undertaking, as to ſatisfy for him, For <hi>There is no Man can Redeem his Brother, or pay God a Ranſom for him, for the Redemption of his Soul is precious,</hi> Pſal. 49.7.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40806:25"/> our Juſtification; ſo that we ſhall have our Sins pardon'd, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to Happineſs: This in ſhort was the Tenour both of the Firſt Covenant, made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Second, procur'd for us by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Not to ſpeak here of the different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Degrees of its Promulgation; nor of that Legal Covenant whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediatour, and was made only with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was annex'd as an Appendix and Codicil to this Covenant of Grace, for Reaſons too many, and too large now to be conſider'd. For tho' to ſhew how, that the whole Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this gracious Covenant, was not made all at once, but that it ſeem'd good to the Divine Wiſdom, that ſo ſtupendious and grand a Scene of Mercy, ſhould not be open'd but by degrees; tho' to ſhew this, I ſay, and the ſeveral Reaſons of adding this Legal Covenant to the Covenant of Grace, may be uſeful Points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to be explain'd in their due time, yet I look upon 'em, as none of the <hi>Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> but rather part of that <hi>Strong Meat,</hi> ſpoke of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>which belongeth to them who are of full Age,</hi> and have been already competently well inſtructed, and and ſo to be no proper Matter of Catechetical Doctrine.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore, and in a word, we may conſider the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> not as ſuch indeed, which is made betwixt a Maſter and his Servant, wherein the Maſter engages to allow Meat, Drink, and Wages, on Condition the Servant will perform unto him ſuch and ſuch Services, which are juſt and reaſonable, and the Servant is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to perform, which expreſſes more the Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, <hi>Do this and Live:</hi> But rather, (for this comes nearer to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, between God and us, which is full of advantageous and profitable Conſiderations on our ſide) we may rather compare it,<note place="margin">It reſembles Articles of Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made thro' the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a Prince's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> I ſay, to an Accord, made betwixt a Gracious Prince, and his Rebellious Subjects, as ſuppoſe ſome City, or State, wherein the Prince is graciouſly pleas'd, through the Interceſſion of ſome great Favourite, to grant unto thoſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not only Pardon of their former Crimes; but moreover, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Priviledges and Freedoms, Protection, and ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Favours, Lands and Poſſeſſions, and the like; on Condition they will thence-forward Renounce and Forſake all his Enemies, and place no farther Truſt, nor Confidence in 'em; and will not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey him for the future in any of his juſt and reaſonable Commands, but pay him a true and faithful Obedience to all his Laws.</p>
            <p>And much of the ſame Nature, I ſay, is the Covenant of Grace, made betwixt God and all Chriſtians, thro' the Mediation of his only Son, only with this difference: That on God's part, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages are of moſt infinite Value, which are made over to us his Rebellious and Diſobedient Subjects; and this upon the moſt reaſonable, juſt, and eaſy Conditions, conſidering the Aſſiſtance he affords us, by the Vertue of the ſame Covenant, to perform 'em. For Almighty God, in the firſt place, vouchſafes us in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to be made <hi>Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Inheritours of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which are Mercies and Priviledges of invaluable Benefit and Advantage to us: And we on the other ſide, Engage, and Promiſe, but to <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40806:25"/> Luſts of the Fleſh; to Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, to Obey God's holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of our Life;</hi> which, I ſay, are moſt reaſonable, juſt, and eaſy Conditions, conſidering the Aſſiſtance he will afford us, to enable us to perform 'em.</p>
            <p>This will very clearly appear, by that time I have Explain'd to you, diſtinctly, and ſeverally, the Terms and Articles of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; both the Advantages made over to us on God's part, and the Conditions to be perform'd on ours, as they are taught you in the Words, now read to you.</p>
            <p>And it is a Subject, indeed, that does extreamly concern you to be well Inſtructed in, and to be conſider'd by you. None of you ſhall be able to perform a Bargain, except you know, what you have bargain'd and agreed to do. No One can diſcharge a Bond, except he knows diſtinctly what he is oblig'd to pay; no more can any of you be able to perform the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> except you do well underſtand the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of it.</p>
            <p>And, indeed,<note place="margin">Little more of univerſal Concernment to be known, but the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this Covenant.</note> there is perhaps but little neceſſary to be known in Religion, beſides the Articles of this Covenant. We may without Prejudice to our Salvation, doubtleſs, be ignorant of many Points, that are Canvaſt with Heat enough, in the Controverſies of Men of all Perſwaſions; but to know what ineſtimable Bleſſings God has Promis'd and Enſur'd to us, and what we are to perform to make our ſelves <hi>Inheritours</hi> of thoſe Bleſſings, is what every Body, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a future State, and the Immortality of his Soul, and that it is worth his while, to ſtudy the Salvation of his Soul, muſt think it neceſſary, except he can imagine it ſafe to take his Journey to Heaven blindfold, when he cannot think of getting, but to his ſhort Home here on Earth, without his Eyes open.</p>
            <p>A diſtinct and clear Underſtanding of the Nature, Terms, and Conditions, and of all that pertains to the Covenant of Grace, is, without doubt, of all things in the World, the moſt neceſſary.<note place="margin">The Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Method moſt uſeful to that Purpoſe.</note> And there is no Method of Inſtruction, whereby it can be ſo diſtinctly and clearly known, as the Catechetical way: For not to ſay, that Preaching, now upon one Head, and immediately after upon another, without any dependance and coherence of the ſeveral parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity together, is not ſo likely to give Perſons a clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Nature and Deſign of Chriſtianity, as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: The Catechetical way, by treating orderly on all the Parts of our moſt Holy Religion, and by giving thereby, a diſtinct View of their natural Connection with, and Dependance one upon another, has this Excellency in it, no doubt, that thereby Perſons ſhall be better able to judge of the beautiful Contexture, and admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the whole; and ſhall eaſily diſcern what End it is, that Chriſtianity aims at, and how admirably every Part of it, is fitted to carry on that great End.</p>
            <p>It is, without all doubt, a moſt uſeful Method of Inſtruction, and it would ſoon appear to be ſo, in its happy Effects, would all Perſons but lay aſide their unhappy Prejudices againſt it, as if it were proper only for Children, to be Hearers thereof: Whereas, indeed, it is no ways unbecoming the Eldeſt, and moſt Knowing Perſons, to hear the great and fundamental Doctrines of Religion, explain'd, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40806:26"/> handled diſtinctly and clearly, and ſeparated from all unneceſſary Mixtures.</p>
            <p>But where all the Means and Methods of Inſtruction are little enough, to give Men a ſufficient Underſtanding in all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; inſtead of comparing 'em one with another, we had better to make uſe of all, and to Pray to God to give a Bleſſing to all his Ordinances, that every one may be uſeful to the Edification, and Salvation of every Chriſtian; which, that they may all prove, may God Almighty grant of his infinite Goodneſs, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>THE Fifth Lecture.</hi> Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THE Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers of your Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, do give you a general Account of all the Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, both of the Priviledges made over to us by God, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be perform'd by us. And theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> expreſſing the Firſt of thoſe invaluable Priviledges made over unto us, in this Covenant, on God's Part; I ſhall therefore endeavour, as well as I can, to Explain and open to you, what they do Import.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is in Scripture often ſtyl'd, The Head of the Church, as particularly <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8. <hi>And he is the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi> it is there ſaid; and we are alſo ſtyl'd, Members of this Body, the Church. Thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones;</hi> ſo that to be a Member of Chriſt, is to be a Member,<note place="margin">A Member of Chriſt, is a Member. of Chriſt's Church</note> or Part of that Body, of which he is the Head, or to be a Member of Chriſt's Church: And to make it appear to you, how happy a Thing it is to be a Member of Chriſt's Church,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you, <hi>What kind of Body the Church of Chriſt is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What it is to be a Member of it.</hi> And then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>What exceeding great and invaluable Priviledges do belong to a Member of Chriſt's Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Firſt, let us ſee, <hi>What kind of Body that is, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt.</hi> And tho' it does not belong to this Part of your Catechiſm, to give you a full account, of all that is Neceſſary to be known, concerning Chriſt's Church, which may more properly be refer'd to that Article of our Creed, <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church:</hi> However, ſince the High Priviledge and Dignity of any <hi>Member,</hi> as a <hi>Member,</hi> cannot be ſufficiently underſtood, nor valued, without knowing the Nature and Excellency of that <hi>Body,</hi> of which it is a <hi>Member;</hi> I do therefore think my ſelf obliged, in order to let you into a through Underſtanding of what is meant by <hi>A Member of Chriſt's Church,</hi> and of the greatneſs of that Priviledge, to ſpeak ſomething largely, in this Place, concerning the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church it ſelf; and I ſhall therefore Define it, and alſo Explain, and prove each Part of the Definition, I ſhall give of it, as follows:</p>

Hence, it is ſo often in the New Teſtament call'd, <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. and <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 11.12. and the Members of it, <hi>Children of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.38. And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21. The Members therefore are ſtyl'd, <hi>Fellow-Citizens, Members of a Houſhold,</hi> and Parts of a <hi>Temple,</hi> all which Expreſſions ſpeak the Church of Chriſt to be a Regular Society of Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd and knit together by Laws, derived from ſome ſupreme Head and Governour. A Society, I ſay, wherein ſome are Superiours, ſome are Inferiours, ſome Governours, ſome Governed, and who altogether make up a well-compacted Body of Men. This laſt cited place out of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſpeaks the Thing out: <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſaith he to thoſe, who are call'd into the Church, <hi>ye are no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, and are built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> that is Governours and Teachers, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt being the the chief Corner-ſtone, in whom all the Building, fitly framed together, groweth up into an Holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Here, in this Deſcription of the Church, you have Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>chief Corner-ſtone,</hi> or Head of the Building, and Body; the Apoſtles and Prophets <hi>Foundation-ſtones,</hi> next unto him, and all the reſt of Chriſtians <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> depending upon Jeſus Chriſt, their ſupreme Head, and Others his ſubordinate Governours, and Teachers, next under him, and the Whole repreſented a well-compacted <hi>Building.</hi> Or, to make it yet more clear to you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. it is ſaid, that <hi>He gave ſome, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and ſome, Prophets: and ſome, Evangeliſts: and ſome, Paſtors and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40806:27"/> Teachers, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> So that upon the whole Matter, you ſee, that the Church of Chriſt is a well-order'd Society of Men.</p>
            <p>And I do withal ſay, that in the Conſtitution of Chriſt's Church it is requir'd, that the <hi>Governours and Paſtors</hi> thereof be <hi>Lawful</hi> Ones, that is, ſuch as Chriſt has Commiſſion'd to thoſe Offices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they Uſurp the ſacred Offices of the Church, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully Ordain'd to the ſame, by the Succeſſors of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there will be very great danger of a Nullity in all their Miniſterial Acts and Offices. You muſt all needs underſtand this, That thoſe, who ſhall pretend to act in any Office, by the King's Authority, without a true Commiſſion, the King will be ſo far from reckoning himſelf Oblig'd, to Confirm what they ſhall pretend to do in his Name, that he will puniſh the Preſumption of ſuch Officers, and thoſe that adhere to 'em. And what reaſon have thoſe to expect better Treatment from the King of Heaven, who ſhall either take upon themſelves the Miniſtry, or recieve an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it from thoſe Hands, who have no Power to Confer it, or ſhall Adhere to ſuch Uſurping Miniſters? To put the caſe as Favourably, as poſſibly we can, it does not appear, that God is under any Promiſe, or Engagement to hear the Prayers, that ſuch Miniſters ſhall put for the People, to convey the Graces of his Holy Spirit, by the Sacraments they ſhall Adminiſter, or to Ratify the Pardon of thoſe Penitents, whom they ſhall Abſolve; whereas he has aſſured the Church, with reſpect to his lawful Miniſters, that whatſoever of this Nature they ſhall do on Earth, ſhall be Eſtabliſh'd in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. And we are farther told by St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 5.4. That under the Old Law, <hi>No Man took the Honour</hi> of the Prieſthood <hi>unto himſelf, but thoſe who were called of God,</hi> as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> And as to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does ſharply demand, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.15. <hi>How any ſhall Preach</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>except they be ſent?</hi> So that it does extreamly concern all Chriſtian People, that the Governours and Paſtors of the Church be lawful Ones, ſuch as are Sent, Ordain'd, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd thereunto.</p>
            <p>And now, if you would be well ſatisfy'd, who are certainly Sent,<note place="margin">An Epiſcopal Clergy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſuch.</note> Ordain'd and Commiſſion'd to Govern and Teach in the Church; it is beyond all doubt, that Biſhops are lawful Governours in the Church of Chriſt, and that thoſe, who are Ordain'd by their Hands, have Commiſſion to Preach the Goſpel, and Adminiſter the Sacraments, becauſe they do undoubtedly derive their Power by an uninterrupted Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for our Saviour, when he ſent forth his Diſciples into the World, to Preach the Goſpel, and to gather a Church, he told 'em, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>He would be with them,</hi> or ſtand by 'em in giving Authority and Succeſs to their Miniſtry, <hi>to the end of the World;</hi> and yet for certain, for 1500 Years he did Authorize no other, than thoſe Epiſcopally Ordain'd, as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all Ages of the Church do teſtify; ſo that it concerns you, who have not that Neceſſity to plead for not Enjoying Biſhops, and an Epiſcopal Clergy, as our Siſter Churches Beyond-Sea think they have; It concerns you, I ſay, as you would be ſecure of being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Pale</hi> of a right Conſtituted Goſpel-Church, not to ſeparate
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40806:28"/> your ſelves from this, wherein you are undoubtedly under a true <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> But to proceed</p>

So that it was rightly ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. Tho' the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did Schiſmatically queſtion it, That <hi>Jeruſalem was the place wherein men ought to Worſhip;</hi> For the Temple was the only place in which the Sacrifices could be Offer'd, and wherein the Prieſts could perform their daily Miniſtration; ſo that the Church, under the Law, was an Incloſure divided from all the World beſides. But our Saviour, at the opening of the Chriſtian Church, aſſures the Woman, who demanded of him, <hi>Whether in that Mountain,</hi> near to <hi>Samaria,</hi> whereon they both ſtood, <hi>or in Jeruſalem, were the place where men ought to Worſhip,</hi> he aſſures her, <hi>The hour cometh when neither in that Mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, they ſhould worſhip the Father;</hi> that is, not there only, nor any where in ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a manner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23. But as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, now under the Goſpel, <hi>In every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him,</hi> Act. 10.35. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he ſent forth his Diſciples into the World, to Preach the Goſpel, and to gather a Church, he commanded them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. ſaying, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> From whence we find them, in <hi>Revelations</hi> 5.9.

The Church is a ſelected People, ſeparated from the Prophane part of the World, to be a <hi>Choſen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a Royal Prieſthood, a Holy Nation, a Peculiar People.</hi> To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand which, you muſt know, that the World, at the Time of our Saviour's coming into it, was grown to a ſad paſs, and was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40806:28"/> Eſtrang'd from God. The World, indeed, ſoon after the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, began to fall off from God, and to take part with the Devil: But by the time that our Saviour came into the Fleſh, the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, 12. concerning as well Jews, as Gentiles, that there <hi>was none that underſtood, there was none that ſought after God; that they were all gone out of the way, they were all become unprofitable, that there was none that did good, no not one.</hi> Particularly, as to the Gentiles, they were charg'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23, 24.28, 29. to have <hi>Changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping things, and were thereupon given up to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and vile Affections; and as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, they were given up to a reprobate Mind, being fill'd with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Fornication, Wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And as to the Jews, they had in a manner wholly voided the Force of God's Laws, by their falſe Interpretations, as you will ſee in our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, which coſt him ſo much Pains to clear the Text from their falſe Gloſſes, and to ſhew them the full Extent of their Duty, contain'd in the Law. This was the State of both Jews and Gentiles, at that time: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did Chriſt come to <hi>Call out</hi> ſuch, as would Obey his Calls, <hi>to Call 'em out,</hi> I ſay, <hi>out of the wicked World, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling;</hi> for which reaſon he is ſaid to have <hi>Saved us, and Called us with an Holy Calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. and in a great many Places of Scripture, Chriſtians are therefore ſtyl'd, the <hi>Called;</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. they are ſaid to be ſuch, whom the <hi>Father had given our Saviour out of the world,</hi> and tho' <hi>they are in the world,</hi> ver. 11. that is, Live in the World, yet <hi>they are not of the world,</hi> ver. 16.</p>
            <p>True it is, It is not every Member of the Viſible Church, that does effectually Obey this Holy Calling, and in his Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſhews himſelf not to be of the World; and therefore it is, that the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, the Church, is liken'd <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24. <hi>to a Field,</hi> in which Wheat and Tares grow up together until the Harveſt; and to a Net that was caſt into the Sea, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd of every Kind: But however, tho' too many of thoſe, of whom the Church is compos'd, are in their own Perſons Ungodly, yet, I ſay,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are <hi>Called, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling,</hi> as Namely, to Repentance from Dead Works;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Repentance from Dead Works.</note> for ſo our Saviour ſays, <hi>He came to Call the Sinners to Repentance,</hi> Matth. 9.13. And thus alſo his Apoſtles <hi>Preacht unto Men, that they ſhould turn from the Vanities of Idol-worſhip, unto the Living God, which made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all Things therein,</hi> Acts 14.15. which is an Inſtance of Repentance, that the Gentile World were particularly Call'd to.</p>
            <p>And then as to the <hi>Knowledge and Belief of the only True God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> To the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Belief and Service of the One True God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</note> 
               <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the diſtinguiſhing Character given of the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. is, that they are ſuch, whom the Father <hi>hath given him</hi> (or <hi>given him out of the world,</hi> as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>that they might have Eternal Life;</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>is Eternal Life;</hi> or the way by which we can only come by Eternal Life, <hi>That we Know the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent.</hi> The Gentiles they Knew not the only True God, but Own'd and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40806:29"/> many Gods, and did Sacrifice to Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. And as for the Jews, tho' they Believ'd, indeed, in the only True God, yet they Acknowledg'd not his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom he had ſent, to be alſo the <hi>True God,</hi> as he is call'd, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. And now both theſe Enemies to Truth, our Saviour Calls <hi>the world,</hi> Joh. 17. and in Oppoſition to both tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that <hi>this is Life Eternal, to Know the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent.</hi> So that the Church of Chriſt are ſuch, who are peculiarly Separated from the World, to the Knowledge and Belief of the Only True God.</p>
            <p>And they are ſuch alſo, who have been Baptiz'd into the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Belief, and Service of Three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in that One Godhead,</hi> Matth. 28.19. And particularly they are ſuch as are <hi>Baptized into the Name of Jeſus,</hi> Acts 19.5. that is, into the Belief, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, or Mediatour between God and Man, for this is the great Fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. aſſuring us, that <hi>Other Foundation can no Man lay, than that Jeſus is the Chriſt.</hi> And he, that <hi>denyeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is the great Liar, and an Anti-Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. But, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is Born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. that is, is Adopted into the Chriſtian Church and Family.</p>

And thoſe who ſtand out, and will not accept of thoſe Priviledges, nor oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their ſeveral Duties, ſhall not be reputed of that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor receive any Advantages from it. And ſo it is here with that Society, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt. It is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, granted us by the King of Heaven, wherein we have the moſt ineſtimable Priviledges, thoſe contain'd in the Goſpel, graciouſly Enſur'd unto us, and moſt reaſonable Duties both to God and Man, required of us, that do embody and join us into one Spiritual Society, the Church; and thoſe who will not Enter into ſuch a Covenant with God, are <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, and Strangers from the Covenantts of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2.12.

            <p>And as by being United in one Covenant, Chriſtians are Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into one Society; ſo by the ſame Means it comes to paſs alſo, that they have <hi>God to be their God, peculiarly, and they become his People.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days,</hi> that is, in the time of the Goſpel, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi> It is the Nature of all Covenants, to Unite the Parties Covenanting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to give to each Party an Intereſt in the other. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8.

And hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. it is ſaid, That <hi>we are all Baptiz'd into one Body,</hi> or admitted by Baptiſm into one Church.</p>

And each of thoſe particular Congregations, alſo in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for Inſtance, were United alſo to the Church of God, in that City, by holding no other than the Doctrine Eſtabliſh'd in that Church: And by being United thereby to that particular Part of Chriſt's Church, they were United alſo to the whole Body of Chriſt, and made up but one Body, <hi>For as the Body is one, and hath many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the Members of that one Body being many, are one Body; ſo alſo is Chriſt, or the Chriſtian Church, for by one Spirit, we are all Baptized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be Bond or Free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. So that the Church of Chriſt, you ſee, tho' divided into many Branches, or Members, is but one Body in the whole, becauſe United in, and by One and the ſame Covenant of Grace: And alſo in the</p>
            <p>Eleventh Place,<note place="margin">As alſo by holding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, in Hearing the Word, in Common-Prayers, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and in affording to each other mutual Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> Becauſe all the ſeveral particular Churches are to <hi>Hold Communion with each other.</hi> Now as to that Communion, which the Members of Chriſt's Church held with one another in the Apoſtle's Times; (and ſure their's muſt be a Pattern of Church-Communion) we are told, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. that it conſiſted in this, That <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers. They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine,</hi> that is, they continued conſtantly, and alſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, without ſwerving aſide by Separation, in Hearing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Teach. They continued alſo ſtedfaſtly in <hi>Breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> that is, they Join'd conſtantly and frequently in the ſame Prayers and Sacraments. And laſtly, They continued ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> by which is principally meant in the Original, both here, and in ſeveral other Places of the Scripture, that Communication of charitable Aſſiſtances, that all the Members did afford each other, according to their ſeveral Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: For whether any Siſter-Church were under Perſecutions, or any particular Chriſtians did labour with Want, the other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body did Communicate to the Relief of either. And the Apoſtle did alſo appoint that to be done in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, when they met together to Communicate in Hearing, Prayers, and Sacraments, ordering, that <hi>The firſt day of the Week,</hi> which was the Day of their Publick Aſſemblies, <hi>every one ſhould lay by him in ſtore, as God had proſpered him,</hi> to this Purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. So that if <hi>One Member ſuffered, all the Members ſuffered with it, and there was no Schiſm in the Body, but the Members had the ſame care one of another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.25, 26.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40806:31"/>
            <p>In a word: Such was the Communion, which the Members of the Church held with each other, in thoſe Days, which made it one Church, that there was no ſuch thing as any ſeparate Meetings, from thoſe of the Apoſtles, and their lawful Succeſſors, the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Flock, ſet up under the Pretence of better Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and for more pure Adminiſtrations of Ordinances. No, no ſooner did any attempt to make ſuch a Schiſm, but he was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Gangreen'd Member, and cut off from the Body for ſo doing. And ſo much was mutual Kindneſs and Charity to be the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of Chriſt's Church, that our Saviour declar'd, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>That by this ſhould all men know his Diſciples, that they had love one for another.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40806:31"/> you, <hi>What kind of Body the of Church of Chriſt is.</hi> And, by the By, from what has been ſaid, it does appear, That the Church of Chriſt is a Spiritual Kingdom, put up in the World by God,<note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt, a ſpiritual Kingdom</note> on purpoſe to reduce Man to his due Allegiance to his Maker, and to deſtroy the Dominion of Satan, which he had ſo long Uſurpt over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is a Kingdom, as it conſiſts of inferior Governours and Subjects, combined together, by ſpecial Laws of Allegiance, to the Sovereign King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and by Priviledges granted, by that Supreme Head and Governour, to ſuch his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore it is ſo often, in the Scripture, call'd a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> But you ſee withal, it is a Spiritual Kingdom, by the Nature and Deſign of which, God is to Rule in the Hearts and Spirits of Men, and therefore it is, all over the New Teſtament, call'd the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> For Chriſt does Reign and Rule therein by his Goſpel, as the Laws of that Kingdom, over the Spirits of Men; and thoſe are the People or Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who own him for their King, and his Goſpel for the Laws of this Kingdom; and who do give themſelves up wholly, both Body, Soul and Spirit, to be Governed by thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>And the Church is alſo often call'd in the Holy Scripture, the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> for indeed it is not a Kingdom of this World, ſupported with outward State, and armed Forces, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and to ſecure from thoſe who would Invade 'em, our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſts; <hi>If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight, that I ſhould not be deliver'd to the Jews,</hi> Joh. 18.36. but it is a Kingdom, or Society of Men, aſſociated together, and Liſted to Fight under Chriſt, the <hi>Great Captain of our Salvation,</hi> againſt much more formidable Enemies, than any Earthly Potentates; <hi>Even againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Liſted, I ſay, to fight under Jeſus Chriſt, the Great Captain of our Salvation, for ſo he is call'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and to our Comfort, who are to fight under him, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>Spoiled theſe Principalities and Powers, and has made a ſhew of them openly upon the Croſs, triumphing over them in it,</hi> Col. 2.15. So that our Work is in a great meaſure already done under his Conduct, for he himſelf has diveſted the Devils of much of their Power, he has thrown 'em out of their Temples, ſilenc'd their Oracles, and does daily, by his Aſſiſtances, enable us to Foil 'em. So that the Church of Chriſt, you ſee, is a Spiritual Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding, that this Society, the Church,<note place="margin">But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a Viſible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> is a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> both as its Laws are Spiritual, reaching to the Government of the Inward Man; and alſo, as it is a Body Liſted under a Spiritual King, to fight againſt Spiritual Enemies: Yet however, from what has been ſaid, it does appear, that the Church, or Kingdom of Chriſt, is a <hi>Viſible Society</hi> of Men, conſiſting of ſuch who make an Outward and Viſible Profeſſion of Allegiance to Chriſt, having viſibly, by an Outward Sacrament, Enter'd into Covenant with him, and being ſuch as do viſibly Communicate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Holy Ordinances. And therefore it is not only of ſuch who by an inward, real, and true Faith are United to Chriſt, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40806:32"/> the Church and Kingdom of God, in this World, does conſiſt, but of all thoſe outward Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who, by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, have Enter'd into Covenant with God. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as beſides an outward Covenanting, (which is certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) are Renew'd withal to the Image of God in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, are the only Perſons of which the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> as it is call'd, does conſiſt in this World, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being meant by the <hi>Little Flock,</hi> Luk. 12.32. and of ſuch only will the whole Church, in the World to come, be made up, being, of <hi>The many that, are Called, the few that are Choſen,</hi> Matth. 20.16. But if we conſider the Church of Chriſt in its full Latitude, and in that imperfect State wherein it now is, on this ſide Heaven; many Hypocrites and bad Men, as well as truly ſincere and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, do belong to it, for the Church of Chriſt, here on Earth, is compar'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24, 25. to a <hi>Field,</hi> which contains <hi>Wheat and Tares growing up together,</hi> and to a <hi>Net,</hi> ver. 47. wherein there are <hi>Fiſh, both good and bad.</hi> Such you ſee is the Nature and Temper of that Body of Chriſt, his Church; concerning which I thought it requiſite to give you a more than ordinary full account, even in this place, before we come to the Article, <hi>I Believe the Holy Catholick Church,</hi> becauſe that otherwiſe it cannot be ſo well Apprehended,</p>

And from what his been ſaid it does eaſily now appear, that a true Member of the Church of Chriſt, is one who belongs to that Society of Chriſtians which conſiſts of Lawful Governours and Paſtors, and of the People of God committed to their Charge, the one Miniſtring in Holy Things, and the other Partaking thereof at their Hands. He is not a Member of that narrow and enclos'd Society of Worſhipers, the Jewiſh Synagogue, who by their peculiar Rites and Ways of Worſhip, were confin'd to one Nation and Place, no more than he is one of the Gentile World at large; but he is one, who either himſelf was call'd, or is deſcended of thoſe who were call'd, from out of the wicked World of Jews and Gentiles, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Belief of the One True God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; as alſo to Repentance from dead Works, to ſerve Him the only Living and True God. And he is call'd, as to Faith and Repentance, ſo to enjoy the Priviledges of the Goſpel, and the Rewards of ſuch Faith and Repentance; namely, Moſt Reaſonable and Excellent Laws and Ordinances, to Conduct him to Heaven, with a plentiful meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance alſo, convey'd by thoſe Ordinances, to Enable him to Obey thoſe Laws; and he is one, who to the End of being of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Men, the Chriſtian Church, and of having God a Friend to him, and he himſelf a Servant of God's, has ſolemnly Enter'd into Covenant with God in his Baptiſm, and continues often to Renew the ſame in the Lord's Supper, becauſe the Divine Goodneſs does in both Vouchſafe to make over and enſure to him thoſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Great and Invaluable Priviledges, and moſt ſingular Benefits, as well as he on the other ſide, does ſolemnly Engage to yield himſelf up to the Service and Obedience of God. Farther yet, a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40806:32"/> of Chriſt's Church is one, who is not only United to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in and by one Covenant, that is, in the Profeſſion of the ſame Faith and Repentance, and in the Enjoyment of the ſame Priviledges, and in the uſe of the ſame Sacraments: But alſo he maintains this Union therewith, by <hi>Communicating</hi> with that particular Part of the Catholick Church where he lives, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is a Member in particular; by communicating, I ſay therewith, in Hearing, together with the reſt of the Body, the ſame Doctrine, in Joyning in the ſame common Prayers, and receiving the ſame Holy Sacraments; and Laſtly, in Receiving from, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring mutual Aſſiſtances to the Members of that Body, wherever diſpers'd, or however diſtreſs'd over the Face of the whole World, as there ſhall be occaſion. And laſtly, a Member of Chriſt's Church is One, who belongs to that univerſal Society of Men, call'd out of the World, to ſuch Duties and Priviledges, as has been ſpoke, and is United into one Body, by the ſame means, as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, under Jeſus Chriſt its ſupreme Head. And if you conſider him as a Member of the Kingdom of Chriſt, he is one who is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by God from the power of Darkneſs, and is tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. that is, he is one of thoſe, who is deliver'd by the Goſpel, from under the Tyranny of Satan, under which the whole World was held Captive, and is made a Subject to the Gracious Government of the Son of God. From what has been ſaid, it does plainly appear, I think, that ſuch, and ſuch a One only, is a true Member of Chriſt's Church.</p>
            <p>And in the Sence of your Catechiſm, which teaches all to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That in their Baptiſm they are <hi>made Members of Chriſt;</hi> every Perſon who has been admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, is a Member of Chriſt, and ſhall continue ſuch till he is cut off by the juſt Sentence of thoſe Governours in the Church, who have the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> to Receive in, or Shut out; or till he cuts off himſelf from that myſtical Body, by a <hi>cauſleſs Schiſm and Separation,</hi> from any of its ſound Parts.</p>
            <p>Every Baptized Perſon, I ſay, is a Member of the Viſible Church.<note place="margin">Every Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſon is a Member of the Viſible Church.</note> So the Apoſtle expreſly ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. aſſuring us, that <hi>As many as have been Baptized into Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Chriſtian Church, <hi>have put on Chriſt,</hi> or have put on that Relation to Chriſt that Members have to the Body. True it is, amongſt thoſe, that are Incorporated by Baptiſm into the Church, many do prove but very unſound and unfruitful Members; ſuch as, tho' they are admitted into that Holy Society, in order to their Edification, and through Converſion, by the means of thoſe Holy Ordinances, which Chriſt has appointed in in his Church, do yet continue to be very bad Men, both in their Principles and Practices. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.10. that of thoſe who are called into the Wedding, that is, the Church, by the Servants or Officers of the Bridegroom, that is, Chriſt, there are as well <hi>Bad as Good.</hi> Yet as appears from that, and many the like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of our Saviour, concerning the Materials and Conſtitution of his Church, even ſuch bad Men, when once Baptized into it, are Members of it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:40806:33"/> Keys, to Receive in, or Shut out. For this you are to know, that Chriſt has given his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the Government of the Church, a <hi>Church Authority,</hi> conſiſting in <hi>Receiving in,</hi> or <hi>Shutting out of the Church. To Receive into the Church,</hi> is to Admit ſuch as make a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; to Admit 'em, I ſay, by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, to all the outward Acts of Communion. <hi>To ſhut, or caſt out of the Church,</hi> is by Excommunication to Exclude unworthy Perſons from that Priviledge of Church-Communion, to deny 'em the Liberty to Pray, or Receive the Sacrament, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Religious Office in the Publick Aſſemblies of the Church. And now accordingly has Chriſt appointed the Biſhops and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church, to be as Shepherds to <hi>Overſee the Flock,</hi> as you will find, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. and has given 'em <hi>The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 16.19. that is, Authority, as to Admit into the Church, by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> all who make a Profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo to Expel out of it, by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> all thoſe ſcabbed Members thereof, who contrary to ſuch their Holy Profeſſion, either by their peſtilent Hereſies, or by their ſcandalous Ill Lives, are Unworthy of it, and in danger to Infect it. If they Preach, or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe propagate any peſtilent Hereſy, contrary to the fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity, let their Perſons be never ſo acceptable, upon the account of ſome ſhining Vertues of Charity, or their Doctrines never ſo Plauſible, as pretending to Reaſon, they ought not to be ſpared. <hi>Tho' we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be Accurſed;</hi> that is, Excommunicated, and cut off from Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. So far was this Bleſſed Apoſtle, ſo Zealous for the Glory of his Saviour, from ſparing others, that he would not have himſelf be ſuffer'd to continue in the Communion of the Church, were it poſſible he ſhould be guilty of propagating Hereſy: And ſo likewiſe is any Perſon, guilty of a notorious and ſcandalous Ill Life. Why then alſo are the Governours of Chriſt's Church commanded, To <hi>put away from 'em that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.13? And all the Members of the myſtical Body, are ſo far bound to take notice of ſuch an <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as to diſown and diſcard ſuch a Perſon, and to have no Society with him, ſo 1 <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one,</hi> after Excommunication, <hi>they were not to Eat.</hi> In ſuch Caſes as theſe, indeed, an Evil Member becomes no Member, and is to be to the reſt as a Heathen Man, and a Publican, that is, one that is out of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.</p>

               <hi>THE Sixth Lecture.</hi> Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>BY the Church of Chriſt, as has been ſhew'd, is meant a <hi>Viſible Society</hi> of Men, call'd forth of the World, to the Knowledge, Belief and Service of the One True God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Profeſſing the ſame in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Service of Satan, and all falſe Gods whatſoever, and alſo to all thoſe vicious and immoral Practices, which did ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accompany the Pagan Worſhip; and indeed profeſſing an utter Hatred to all Sin, of any kind. And it is a Society, as has been ſhew'd you, combin'd into one Covenant with God, by outward Sacraments, and holding Communion with each other, under Jeſus Chriſt its Head.</p>
            <p>And a Member of Chriſt's Church, you have alſo ſeen, is every One, who has been Enter'd into this viſible Society of Holy Men, and into this Covenant with God, by Baptiſm, and who holds a conſtant Communion, without ſwerving aſide into ſeparate Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, with that Particular, True, and Orthodox Church, whereof he is a Member, and in whoſe Verge he lives. Every ſuch Perſon, I have ſhew'd you, is a Member of Chriſt's Church, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch, except his Lawful Governours therein, ſhould cut him off by a juſt Excommunication, or he ſhould cut off himſelf by a ſinful and unneceſſary Separation.</p>
            <p>And now having ſufficiently made it appear, in the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this purpoſe, Firſt, what kind of Body that is, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt, and alſo, Secondly, having ſhew'd you, what it is to be a Member of it; it will be now requiſite, that I ſhould alſo Demonſtrate to you, (in order to make you ſufficiently ſenſible of which, the Two former Points have been ſo largely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of) Thirdly, what vaſt and invaluable <hi>Priviledges</hi> do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly belong to every Member of Chriſt's viſible Church. I ſay, to <hi>Every Member of Chriſt's viſible Church,</hi> for it is not my Buſineſs here to Enlarge on the more peculiar Priviledges of thoſe, who are ſtyl'd Members of the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> who are the ſincere Part only of Chriſt's viſible Church. Thoſe perhaps, I may alſo declare in few words by the By. But the Priviledges, which I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to Treat upon, and to Acquaint you with, are ſuch as belong to every Member of the Church I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:40806:34"/>
            <p>And theſe Priviledges,<note place="margin">The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of our being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Church.</note> which do peculiarly belong to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Church, as they are the Members of ſuch a Body, whereof he is the Head, are theſe Two: Firſt, a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, together with moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and edifying Inſtitutions and Ordinances, appointed by Him, our ſupreme Head and Governour, to conduct us to Heaven. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a ſufficient meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, deriv'd down upon us, from Him our myſtical Head, and convey'd by thoſe his Ordinances, to Enable us to conform to his Religion, and Obey thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Great <hi>Priviledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> A moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Body of Religion, Laws, and Ordinances.</note> which does peculiarly belong to all the Members of Chriſt's viſible Church, as they are the Members of ſuch a Society, <hi>Is a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, together with moſt profitable and edifying Inſtitutions and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, given and appointed us by him our ſupreme Head and Governour, to Conduct us to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do enjoy, I ſay, thereby,<note place="margin">The Chriſtian Religion, and Laws, far exceed the Pagan, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan, or Jewiſh.</note> 
               <hi>The Priviledge of a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, far exceeding what any other People have ever enjoy'd, to Conduct us to Heaven.</hi> This is clearly to be ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11. where God himſelf finding Fault with the Jewiſh Covenant and Laws, as what <hi>could not make the Comers thereunto Perfect,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold, the days come, when I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah; not according to the Covenant, that I made with their Fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> which remarkable Words, ſpoke firſt by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as a Prophecy of the moſt happy State of the Chriſtian Church, by reaſon of the moſt excellent Covenant and Laws that would be given it, beyond what was the State of the Jewiſh, do import, that even the Jewiſh Covenant was not in it ſelf Perfect, and ſuch as could not be better'd and improv'd, tho' it had God for its Author; (and ſure then thoſe Superſtitions, which derive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from no better Authors than the Devil, and wicked Impoſtors, muſt be very bad) but that the Chriſtian Covenant, and Laws have ſuch an inward, eſſential Goodneſs in them, that a Man's own Reaſon would prompt him to Approve 'em as Beſt, and moſt Excellent; there being none of its Doctrines, but what are highly agreeable to the beſt Reaſon of Man, and all its Precepts being no other, than the Law written in every Man's own Heart.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Chriſtian Religion, whether we conſider it, as compar'd with the Pagan, or Mahometan Superſtition, and Jewiſh Diſpenſation, or in its own Nature, it is a moſt ſingular Inſtitution, and Body of Laws, and ſuch as we ought to Eſteem it our very great Happineſs and Advantage, above other Men, that we are under the Government of 'em.</p>

Firſt, it is a plain Impoſture and Cheat, pretending to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd by God, to his Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after the Jewiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as a more perfect Inſtitution than either, whereas, indeed, look into the whole Matter, and inward Frame thereof, and we ſhall find nothing in it, as One obſerves, but a <q>Maſs of fooliſh
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40806:35"/> Opinions, odd Stories, uncouth Ceremonies, compounded chiefly of the Dregs of Chriſtian Hereſies, together with ſome Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of Judaiſm and Paganiſm, confuſedly jumbled, or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mixt one with the other.</q> But as to that great Principle of it, which promiſes in Paradiſe a Thouſand Years ſatisfaction, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſenſual Pleaſures, and the Enjoyment of Women, to thoſe, who ſhall ſlay the Unbelievers, that is, Chriſtians; (for ſo they do call us eſpecially, becauſe we believe not in their <hi>Mahomet.</hi>) This one Principle of their Religion, I ſay, is enough to debauch Humane Nature to the loweſt Degree of Naughtineſs, by giving Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Two worſt of Sins, Luſt, and Cruelty;<note place="margin">Its Principles tend to Luſt, and Cruelty.</note> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effects of it are, That they give an unbounded Range to their Luſts amongſt themſelves, and are Cruel and Blood-thirſty to all the World beſides, being Inſtigated by their very Religion, to fill the whole Earth with War, Deſolations and Miſery; ſo that this is another Religion alſo, which Tends, inſtead of Improving, to deprave Humane Nature, and to make it much worſe.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, As to the Jewiſh Religion,<note place="margin">Judaiſm was an imperfect and unfiniſht Draught of Religion.</note> tho' that indeed was of a Divine Original, yet whether it were that the Infancy of the World was not ripe for a more deep and manly Inſtruction; or whether that particular Nation however, to whoſe Diſpoſition and Capacity thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions were ſuited, was unfit for the higheſt and hardeſt Leſſons; ſo it was, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls their Ordinances, <hi>Poor and Beggarly Elements,</hi> Gal. 4.9.3. And indeed as to the Ritual Part of their Law, the Ceremonies and Sacrifices thereof, were for the moſt part Types and <hi>Shadows of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10.1. And as to the Moral Part, <hi>Moſes for the hardneſs of their Hearts,</hi> was forc'd to Indulge 'em, what the Perfection and Purity of the Chriſtian Religion, will by no means allow of, as may be ſeen in the Caſe of <hi>Putting away a Wife for every Cauſe,</hi> Luke 19.8. But above all, it is to be conſider'd, that univerſal Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Enemies, to all Mankind, of what Nation and Religion ſoever they be, which does ſo nearly reſemble us to God himſelf, <hi>Who maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good,</hi> Matt. 5.45. was as it were a <hi>New Commandment to them,</hi> Joh. 13.34. And yet ſuch an unbounded Charity and Kindneſs, as this, is the great and neceſſary Duty of Chriſtianity. So that Judaiſm at the beſt, and before that it was Corrupted by the falſe Interpretations put upon the Law, by the Scribes and Phariſees, was but an imperfect Draught of Religion, begun by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but left to be finiſhed by the more perfect Stroaks of our Saviour's Pencil afterwards, who is therefore ſaid to have <hi>Come, not to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fill 'em up,</hi> Matth. 5.17. Thus Imperfect at beſt, was the Jewiſh Law. But now conſider</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The whole Body of that Religion,<note place="margin">Christianity a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religion.</note> which Chriſt our ſupreme Head and Governour has given us, and under whoſe Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we have the Happineſs to be, as we are the <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> and nothing can repreſent God in more Noble Characters, and Glorious Perfections; nothing can give a more Honourable and Rational Account of his Proceedings with Man, both in his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Redemption of him, than it does. And as his Laws are infinitely beyond what the Wiſdom of any Humane Law-givers
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40806:36"/> did ever yet contrive for the good Order of Man in this World, and his real Happineſs both in this, and the World to come; ſo no Motives, nor Reaſons can poſſibly be more Powerful, than thoſe, which Chriſtianity does give us, to Obey thoſe Laws.</p>

               </note>And then as to his Proceedings with Man, both in his Creation and Redemption of him. Chriſtianity gives us the moſt Plain and rational Account thereof in the World. It gives us to know how that God made Man Upright, and being ſo, we were at perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with him; but that afterwards we fell by Tranſgreſſion from him, and muſt have ſuffered the Doom of Rebels for ſo doing. It lets us then know, That God taking Pity of us in this miſerable Caſe, ſent his own Son to Preach Repentance, and to offer Terms of Reconciliation to us. And moreover, becauſe it was not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with God's Holineſs, nor with his Wiſdom and Juſtice, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, to let Sin go unpuniſh'd, or to accept of a Sacrifice and Satisfaction leſs infinite in <hi>Value,</hi> than he was in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> who was Offended, that he therefore gave this his only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son alſo to Dye for us, and accepted of his infinitely Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sufferings here, inſtead of our ſuffering Eternally hereafter; and as a ſufficient Satisfaction to his injur'd Juſtice, which we in our own Perſons could not pay, without periſhing Everlaſtingly. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity does withal Reveal to us, that this our High-Prieſt, after having Offer'd himſelf for us here on Earth, a Sacrifice for our Sins, he is now gone into Heaven, to Intercede with the Father, in the Merit thereof, that it may be accepted to the Pardon of 'em. And it alſo Informs us, that being Aſcended to his Father, which is in Heaven, in order fully to Reconcile him to Man, he has ſubſtituted his Holy Spirit here on Earth, to perfect the Reconciliation and Conformity of our Natures to God, by moving and moulding our Hearts to true Repentance, and Faith in him.</p>
            <p>This is in ſhort, that account which Chriſtianity gives us, both of our Creation and of our Redemption. And ſo every way Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional it is in it ſelf, and ſo exceedingly agreeable to the wiſeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Government in the World, that tho' it was beyond the reach of our Reaſons, before this whole Myſtery of Redemption was Reveal'd to us in the Goſpel, to think of ſuch an extraordinary way for our Recovery out of a loſt and undone Condition, and of Reconciliation to God; yet now ſince it is Revealed, all the reaſon of Mankind, whoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings the God of this world hath not blinded,</hi> muſt own, that there is no method of Proceeding in ſuch a Caſe, could be more worthy of the Holineſs, Juſtice, Mercy and Wiſdom of God, nor ſo likely to work Repentance in Man, nor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40806:36"/> conſequently more agreeable to the wiſe Governour of the World to take, than this. So agreeable to the beſt improved reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are the Doctrinal, and even the moſt myſterious Parts of the Chriſtian Religion, that Religion, which it is our Happineſs, as we are Members of Chriſt's Church, to be under the Direction of.</p>
            <p>Nor can any thing be better contrived for the Happineſs of Men,<note place="margin">Its Laws a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> excellently contrived for the good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Mankind.</note> with relation to themſelves, or others, than what the Laws of our Saviour do directly tend to. As to our ſelves, they do ſo powerfully tend to mortify our Luſts and Appetites, thoſe Rebels to our own Reaſon, to moderate our Paſſions and Affections, which ſo violently rack and diſturb our own Breaſts; and they are excellently fitted alſo, to make us ſo Humble and Self-denying, ſo Temperate and Sober, ſo Chaſt and Pure, as Men on Earth would appear to be Angels come from Heaven, were the Laws of Chriſt univerſally followed. And laſtly as to Others, ſuch Juſtice and Uprightneſs, ſuch Charity and Kindneſs, ſuch Quiet and Peaceableneſs, does Chriſtianity incline Men to, (upon which account the State of the Goſpel is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that, <hi>In which nothing ſhould deſtroy, nor hurt in the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> Iſa. 11.9.) And let me alſo add, ſuch Prudent and Fatherly Care of Children, Servants and Dependants, do the Laws of Chriſt preſcribe, as would make a Heaven here upon Earth, were they univerſally Obey'd. I ſay, were they univerſally Obey'd.</p>
            <p>And yet to add to all this Excellency of Chriſt's Government and Laws, over us already ſeen, ſo Powerful is our Obedience to all theſe Laws Enforc'd by thoſe mighty Principles and Motives of Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">And are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by moſt powerful Principles and Motives.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> The Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, I mean, ſo very Perſwaſive and Forcible are the Motives, which Chriſt does give us to the Practiſe of theſe Vertues, beyond what was in any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Motives, which the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> or even <hi>Moſes</hi> did give, the Gentiles, or the Jews, to be in any degree Vertuous, that this is another addition to our Advantage, in having Chriſt for our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head</hi> and Law-giver, and in being <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church.</hi> In a word, ſo Honourable to God, ſo Perfective of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo Beneficial to mankind are the Laws of Chriſt, and ſo well is our Obedience ſecur'd to 'em, by thoſe Principles he has taught us, that this very Thing does ſpeak our exceeding Great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, in being Members of Chriſt, and under his Conduct and Government, as our ſupreme Head and Law-giver.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially this Advantage will appear to be very Great, if we conſider, <hi>How that together with thoſe moſt excellent Laws, that he has given us, he has alſo appointed us moſt Edifying and comfortable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another Branch of this firſt Part of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are most Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Ordinances.</note> 
               <hi>to conduct us to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by Divine <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> I do mean thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Appointments and Obſervations, which he has given his Church, and all the Members thereof, for their Improvement in the Knowledge and Practice of his Holy Religion and Laws. And that which our Great Law-giver has done of this Nature, is this; He has Ordain'd ſolemn and ſet Days, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chriſtian Sabbaths, for his own Service; He has Order'd that publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of all Chriſtians ſhould be held upon thoſe Days; He has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd and Commanded the Publication and Preaching of his Laws at thoſe publick Aſſemblies; He has appointed that Common
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40806:37"/> Prayers, Supplications and Thankſgivings, for Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, to Enable us to perform theſe Laws then Preacht, and for other Mercies, ſhould be jointly put up to him by all Chriſtians on thoſe ſolemn Days, and publick Aſſemblies; And laſtly, he has En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd therein the uſe of Sacraments, as means of Conveying ſuch Grace and Aſſiſtance, and alſo as Oaths and Obligations upon us to be Obedient to thoſe Laws. All which are the Priviledges that do belong to the Members of Chriſt's <hi>Viſible Church.</hi> And if we compare 'em with what others want of this Nature, they are indeed moſt ſingular Favours, vouchſafed only to ſuch as are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, and which <hi>Aliens and Strangers</hi> have no Right, nor Admittance to.

To underſtand which Rights and Priviledges the better, you muſt know, that as there are <q>Two ſorts of Members in the viſible Church, ſo there are Two kinds of Priviledges that belong to each ſort, as One rightly ſtates this Matter, each having thoſe Priviledges, which are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to 'em, according to the relation they bear to the Head, and their Fellow-members.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <q>There are Members only by <hi>Foederal</hi> or <hi>Covenant Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> ſuch are only Born of Water, when by Baptiſm they are United to Chriſt and the Church, and took upon them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice of the Chriſtian Religion. Now the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that do belong to theſe, are of the ſame make with their Church-Memberſhip, Outward, and conſiſting only in outward and publick Communion with the Church, in Word and Ordinances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <q>There are <hi>Members by Real and Inherent Holineſs,</hi> ſuch as are, not only Born of Water, but of the Spirit alſo, when by the inward Operation of the Holy Ghoſt their Souls are Renew'd after the Image of God, and made Partakers of a Divine Nature. And the Priviledges that do belong to theſe, are not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Ones, but together with them, others that are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their more ſpiritual Relations, Inward, and ſuch as conſiſt in the ſpecial and particular Care and Protection of God,</q> and in the more plentiful Meaſures of his Grace, and in the more ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Holy Spirit, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every One that hath,</hi> or Improveth thoſe Talents of Grace he has received, <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi> So that theſe latter, and more peculiar Priviledges indeed, do not belong to every Member of the viſible Church, but to thoſe only, who are ſincere in their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and who, by their more than ordinary Piety, are become Dear to God.</p>
            <p>But then, as to <hi>Outward Priviledges,</hi> it is not only the Duty, but it is the Priviledge, which of Right belongs to Every <hi>Member</hi> of Chriſt's Church, to Obſerve the Lord's Day, to be Preſent in the Publick Aſſemblies, to Join in the Common Prayers, and even to Partake, when of Age, of the Lord's Supper. So we find, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. That the whole <hi>Three Thouſand Souls, who received the Word,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40806:37"/> and were Baptized, continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtle's Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>

            <p>True it is, ſuch is that more than ordinary Regard, that the Church, of Chriſt has for the Lord's Supper, that moſt ſolemn Ordinance in the Chriſtian Religion, that when any Member becomes Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous for any Sin, he is to be <hi>Suſpended from Communion in that, till he amends:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scandalous Members to be ſuſpended from the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> So it is order'd in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> before the <hi>Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> that if any be an open and notorious Evil-Liver, ſo that the Congregation be thereby Offended; The Curate, having Knowledge thereof, ſhall Call him, and Advertiſe him, that in any-wiſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to come to the Lord's Table, until he hath openly declared himſelf to have truly Repented, and Amended his former Naughty Life, that the Congregation may thereby be ſaisfy'd, which before were Offended. And the ſame Order ſhall the Curate uſe with thoſe, betwixt whom he perceiveth Malice and Hatred to reign, not ſuffering them to be Partakers at the Lord's Table, till he Knows them to be Reconciled. But otherwiſe, till a Member become No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and Scandalous for his Evil Principles, or Practices, he may claim the <hi>Right</hi> to be Admitted to the Lord's Supper; for even <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, before he Betray'd our Saviour, did Partake with him at the firſt Inſtitution of the Supper, as you will find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.25, 26. So that as to the Outward Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt, they are Priviledges, you ſee, that do belong to all the Members of Chriſt's Church, to all ſuch as have been Baptized, and Profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians. And now</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>If we compare but theſe Outward Priviledges of God's Holy Ordinances, with what others do want of this Nature, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt ſingular Favours, vouchſafed only to ſuch as are Members of Chriſt's Church, and which Aliens and Strangers have no Right, nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to.</hi>

And hence it comes to paſs, that thoſe miſerable People continue ſtill in Blindneſs, Ignorance and Barbarity; remain perfect Slaves to Satan, and their own Brutiſh Luſts, and for the moſt part of 'em, are degenerated into ſuch Inhumanity, Cruelty, and Brutality, that Tygers, Wolves, and Vipers, the moſt Devouring and Venemous Creatures in the World, are not ſo miſcheivous to Mankind, as that Part thereof, who either know not, or contemn God's Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, are one to another: So true it is, what <hi>Solomon</hi> has Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. that <hi>Where there is no Viſion,</hi> or no Word and Ordinances of Divine Revelation, <hi>the People periſh.</hi> Which brings me</p>

In theſe Holy Ordinances we have all the Means both Outward, and Inward, afforded for our Converſion. As to the Outward, you have the very Scriptures themſelves, the Body of thoſe Holy Laws, publickly Proclaim'd and Read out to you; the Scripture it ſelf, I ſay, <hi>Which was given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 17. In theſe Holy Ordinances again, you are not left to the Deceits and Whiſpers of a private Spirit, but you have the Doctrine of the Church, collected into a <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> and containing all that is neceſſary, whether as to <hi>Faith,</hi> or that <hi>Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or which is required in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. You have this Collected, I ſay, partly by the Apoſtle's themſelves, and partly by others, the wiſeſt and beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines out of the Holy Scriptures, and propos'd to you as a Rule to walk by: And moreover you have the Miniſters of Chriſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Applying both to your direction: The Miniſters of Chriſt, I ſay, who as his <hi>Ambaſſadors do Pray you in Chriſt's ſtead to be Reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. Again, In theſe Holy Ordinances, you do not wreſtle with God for his Mercies, in the ſtrength only of your own private Prayers, but you have your Devotions mingled with the concurrent Prayers of all God's People, and ſo by your joint Forces, after an humble, but powerful manner, do Beſiege Heaven; for the <hi>joint and united Prayers</hi> of Chriſtians have, above all others, the Promiſe of a Gracious Anſwer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. Our Saviour aſſuring us there, that <hi>Where Two or Three are gather'd together in his Name, there he will be in the midſt of them.</hi> And laſtly, You receive herein, from the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that Food, which is neceſſary to the Nouriſhment of the Soul, as Meat is to the Strength of the Body, the ſame Bleſſed Saviour of the World aſſuring us, as you will ſee, <hi>John</hi> 6.55. and the 63. compar'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that <hi>His Fleſh is Meat indeed, and that his Blood is Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> And then as to the Inward Means of performing God's Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grace and Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, this, as it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to enable our Weakneſs in this our faln State; ſo it is no otherwiſe to be expected than in the Uſe and Miniſtry of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, as ſhall be preſently ſeen.</p>
            <p>In a word, The outward Ordinances, and Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, together with the Holy Spirit accompanying them, are the only ordinary Means of <hi>Converſion.</hi> Some may pretend to be <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> but Experience tells us, that accordingly as Men do ſlight and neglect 'em, accordingly do they decay in Grace and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and when once they begin wholly to lay them aſide, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfectly Graceleſs, and are given up to a Reprobate Mind, as is daily ſeeni in ſuch as make nothing of Profaning the Lord's Day, and do totally lay aſide Prayers and Sacraments.</p>

The Lawful Governours and Teachers in the Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40806:39"/> are the principal Parts in the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> as the Heart, the Liver, and the Brain, are in the Natural. For as in the <hi>Natural,</hi> from theſe principal Parts are ſent forth that Portion of Blood and Spirits, which give Life and Strength to every ſingle Member; ſo from Chriſt's Miniſters, is Communicated to all the Members of the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> that Nouriſhment, which maintains the ſpiritual Life in them. All this may be fairly gather'd from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> In which Words, the Miniſters of Chriſt's Church, whether Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, or Ordinary, as Paſtors and Teachers, are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, for the Holding and Knitting together the Church, and that from them each Member does immediately receive that Nouriſhment of ſound Doctrine, whereby he grows up to be a Perfect Man in the Knowledge, and Practice of true Religion. And indeed, the Graces of the Holy Spirit are Convey'd by thoſe Ordinances, which they only have power to Adminiſter, which brings me</p>

For juſt again, as in the <hi>Body Natural,</hi> there are Nerves that Branch from the Head through the Body, conveying the Animal Spirits to every Member thereof; ſo in the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> the Church, there are the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of <hi>Sacraments, Preaching, Publick and Common Prayers, and ſuch like Holy Offices,</hi> Adminiſtred by Perſons ſet apart for that Purpoſe, to be the Conveyances of thoſe ordinary Supplies of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which he thinks neceſſary to preſerve that Member in Health and Vigour. So that thus at length you ſee, how that in keeping in Union with the myſtical Body of Chriſt, his Church, and with its Lawful Governours and Teachers, and in the uſe of Sacraments, and other Divine Ordinances, thoſe Conduits and Conveyances of of his Holy Spirit to us, we ſhall have ſpiritual Life, and Strength, and Vigour, derived down to us from Chriſt, our ſpiritual Head, in like manner, as in the natural Body of Man, the Animal Life, and Strength, and Vigour, is derived down to all the parts of the Body, from the natural Head.</p>

And whatever, I ſay, thoſe ſeveral Duties are, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40806:40"/> ariſe from their ſeveral Stations in the Church, they ſhall have a competent meaſure of Divine Grace, Enabling them to diſcharge 'em. They ſhall not have Gifts, that are neceſſary to the Diſcharge of other's Offices, but not of their own; that is, a private Chriſtian call'd to no Office in the Church, is not to expect, nor ought to pretend to have received Gifts of Government, and Teaching in a publick Miniſterial way, <hi>For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. But every Member of the myſtical Body, by keeping himſelf United to the Head, in ſuch ways, as has been ſhew'd, ſhall have ſuch Graces and Aſſiſtances derived down to him from Chriſt, who is that Head, as are neceſſary and proper for him.</p>
            <p>And, that too, in ſuch Meaſures and Proportions,<note place="margin">And alſo in ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times and Occaſions in the Church, are wanting.</note> as, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Times and Occaſions in the Church, are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel, when the Work was ſo Extraordinary, that there was need of Miracles to convince the Jews of the Inſufficiency of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the Gentiles of the Falſhood of the Pagan Superſtition, then did Chriſt beſtow upon his Apoſtles divers Extraordinary <hi>Gifts,</hi> viz. <hi>Of Miracles, Prophecy, diſcerning of Spirits, divers kind of Tongues, and the Interpretation of Tongues,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.10. And as to all Chriſtians in general, as the Malice of Satan did then moſt violently rage againſt the Church, Perſecuting to the Death thoſe, who would not <hi>Renounce Chriſt, and his Religion;</hi> ſo all the Chriſtians in thoſe Times were very extraordinarily Strengthen'd, no doubt, to Reſiſt ſuch ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But now, that the Church is Eſtabliſh'd, and the Truth of Chriſtianity already Prov'd and Believ'd, God does aſſiſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Religion only, with the ordinary Graces of his Spirit in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry. And as to Lay Chriſtians therefore, except it be when the Orthodox are call'd out in any Part of the World (as ſometimes they are to this Day) to ſuffer for the Truth, they receive no other than ordinary Aſſiſtances. But this both Miniſters and People are ſure to do, in the uſe of thoſe Means, that Chriſt has Appointed in his Church for that Purpoſe; ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, on many accounts, are the Priviledges, that do belong to the Members of Chriſt's Church.</p>

            <p>And ſuch a vaſt Change wrought in our Natures by the Word and Spirit of God, may very juſtly give thoſe, who Enjoy it, the Title of the <hi>Children of God;</hi> for if in the way of <hi>Natural Generation,</hi> the Communicating of a Principle of Life, and of ſuitable Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, does found the Relation and Title of a <hi>Father,</hi> there is as good Reaſon why in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the deriving ſuch Holy and Heavenly Diſpoſitions and Powers from the Word, and the Spirit of God to the Soul, as give to a Man a Divine Nature, whereby he is a Partaker of the Life and Likeneſs of God himſelf, ſhould Entitle God to be alſo a Father, and ſuch, who are ſo Regenerated and Renew'd, his Children. And accordingly in the Holy Scripture we find, that ſuch a derivation of Strength and Grace from the Word and Spirit of God, does Entitle thoſe, who are Renew'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to be Children of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only attributing to the Miniſtry of the Word, a Power of <hi>Begetting in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15: But withal expreſly aſſuring us, that <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14. So that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>Child of God,</hi> whoever giving himſelf up to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of God's Word and Spirit, is thereby <hi>Sanctify'd wholly in his own Spirit, Soul and Body,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. ſo as to ſudue and mortify every Luſt, and every naughty, inordinate and worldly Deſire.</p>
            <p>And indeed every truly Regenerate Child of God does do ſo; ſuch a One does by the power of the Word, and in the uſe and ſtrength of that Grace, that God does afford him, ſubdue and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify every Luſt, and every naughty, inordinate, and worldly Deſire. So we are expreſly told, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is Born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is horn of God;</hi> that is, a ſanctify'd Child of God, does really hate Sin, the very Temper and Bent of his Soul is againſt it; and as to living in any groſs and wilful Sin, he cannot without much Reluctancy force himſelf to it; his renew'd Nature is ſo much contrary thereto.

And as to the meaning of a Child of God, here in your Catechiſm, it is alſo plain, tht it; is not only ſuch as are Renew'd in the Spirit of their minds, and do imitate God, that are there to be underſtood; for every One, who is Catechized, is requir'd to Anſwer, that <hi>In his Baptiſm he was made a Child of God,</hi> whereas many Catechumens are not actually as yet Renew'd, and really Converted, and by their own Fault, many will never be; ſo that a Child of God, by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regeneration, and a God-like Imitation, expreſſes rather the Duty of every One, what he ought to be, than the Notion and Nature of a Priviledge, which many may Enjoy, who in the mean time are not over Dutiful. So that a Child of God by ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or a God-like Imitation, is a meaning of the Word, as much too narrow to be the ſence of it, here in your Catechiſm, as a Child by Creation was too wide.

But the Jews being ſtill of a Childiſh Diſpoſition, and fond of their Chains, as People, long accuſtomed to Slavery, commonly are, would not forego their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Obſervances for the more Manly Religion, and more <hi>reaſonable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40806:43"/> Service</hi> of the Goſpel of the Bleſſed Jeſus. And thus refuſing Chriſt,<note place="margin">But the Jews adhering to their Law, and refuſing Chriſt, and his Goſpel, in whom God had predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated all to be his Sons, the Apostles turned unto Gentiles, Preaching Chriſt, and Salvation to them, and to as many as received him, to them gave he Power to be the Sons of God.</note> in whom <hi>God did predeſtinate us all into the Adoption of Children by himſelf, according to the good Pleaſure of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by the appointment of God, did thereupon <hi>turn to the Gentiles Acts</hi> 13.46, 47. Preaching Chriſt and Salvation by him, unto them, and <hi>to as many as Receiv'd him, to them gave he power,</hi> or the Right and Priviledge, as it is in the Original, <hi>to become the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12. This is a remarkable Text to our Purpoſe. In the Two Verſes immediately before, <hi>viz.</hi> The 10, and 11, it is ſaid, <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not; he came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them gave he Power,</hi> or the Right and Priviledge, <hi>to be the Sons of God, even to them, who Believe in his Name.</hi> So, that by this time, I hope it does fully appear to you, what is meant by a <hi>Child of God,</hi> eſpecially in that ſence, wherein it is to be underſtood here in your Catechiſm. And you ſee, as he is not every Child by Creation, which is a ſence too wide; ſo neither on the other ſide, is he only One, who is ſo by Regeneration, which is a ſence as much too narrow; but every one is ſuch, who has Enter'd into Covenant with God, and whom the Heavenly Father, has thereupon <hi>Adopted</hi> into his Family, to partake of the Priviledges, which belong to his Adopted Sons, which,</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What are the Priviledges, which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Children of God, as ſuch.</note> Brings me next to Enquire what a Vaſt Priviledge it is, accordingly, to be <hi>made the Children of God.</hi> And truly upon Enquiry it will be found to be in general the very ſame Priviledge in Kind, but infinitely greater in Degree, (as Heavenly Things are always greater than Earthly) which the moſt Tender and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father, that is withal Wiſe, as well as Good, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to allow his own Children,<note place="margin">In general, ſuch as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, but wiſe Father, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to allow his Children beyond Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and Strangers.</note> beyond what he will do to <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Aliens.</hi> For is it natural to ſuch a One more eaſily to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Offences of his Child, than of his Slave, more favourably to over-look his Infirmities, more readily to hear his Requeſts, and to inſtate him in a ſurer Title to his Poſſeſſions, than he will do others, that have no ſuch Relation to him? Why ſuch are the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges our Heavenly Father will allow to us, who are his Children by <hi>Adoption,</hi> above others, who ſtand in no ſuch Relation to him. He will be Juſt to all, but theſe are properly Fatherly Kindneſſes, and he will Indulge 'em to none therefore but thoſe, who are his Children. But more particularly,<note place="margin">Particularly,</note>

            <p>Firſt, It is worthy our Conſideration,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Pardon of all Sins, upon hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> that we ſhall have this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Priviledge, by being his Children, above the reſt of Mankind, namely. We ſhall have all our Sins Pardon'd, upon our hearty Repentance of 'em, upon Condition we forſake 'em, and return to God. The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, and all Perſons remaining in a State of Nature, who have not Embrac'd the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who have not been Baptized, nor have Enter'd into Covenant with God, have no Aſſurance from him, that their Sins ſhould be ever Pardon'd, tho' they ſhould forſake 'em, becauſe God never gave any Promiſe of Pardon to any other but his Children, who are in Covenant with him:</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40806:44"/>
            <p>And for want of their having any expreſs Engagements and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes from God, of Mercies from him, does the Apoſtle therefore ſpeak of the State of the Gentiles, as exceedingly Uncomfortable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12. in theſe very remarkable Words, <hi>Remember that ye being in times paſt Gentiles in the fleſh, that at that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, Strangers from the Covenants and Promiſes, having no hopes</hi> of Pardon, <hi>and without a God in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we Chriſtians, who have Enter'd into Covenant with God, and ſo are his Children, have the utmoſt Aſſurance poſſible, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the moſt gracious and expreſs Promiſes, that upon laying down our Rebellious Arms upon our Renouncing of his, and our own moſt mortal Enemies, our Sins, and Coming over to him, we ſhall have all our Sins Pardon'd. Or rather as the Apoſtle himſelf does Expreſs it in the following, <hi>viz.</hi> The 13, 14 ver. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt, for he is our Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, that this Pardon and Peace with the Father, does more peculiarly belong to us under the Character of his <hi>Children,</hi> who had formerly ſtray'd afar off from him, by our Sins, but are now return'd Home to him, by Repentance; we have Exemplify'd to us in that famous Parable of the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. That Perſon, we there read, after a moſt Lewd and <hi>Riotous Life,</hi> after he had ſpent and ſquander'd away all his Subſtance, that his Father gave him, yet upon his deep Humiliation, for his Vile and Undutiful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards his Father, and his hearty Deſires to return Home, and to his Duty and Obedience to him, was thereupon admitted to his former Intereſt in his Father's Affections; Yea, and receiv'd with more than uſual Joy. Why, the whole Deſign of that Parable is to ſhew us, how our Heavenly Father will graciouſly deal with us, his Undutiful and Rebellious Children; and that after, even a very Ill Life, upon our laying down of our Sins, the forſaking the ſervice of our Luſts, and Return to him, he will graciouſly Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us, his <hi>Children.</hi>

The Rigour of the Firſt Covenant would admit of no leſs than a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſinning Obedience,</hi> the never Offending in any One Point. <hi>In the day thou doſt Eat thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye,</hi> Gen. 2.17. But here under the Second, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deals with us with the Indulgence of a tender Parent, who does not throw off his Child, and withdraw his Kindneſs upon the ſmalleſt Offences, and ſuch as through Ignorance, Surprize, or the like, cannot in this our fall'n and corrupt State be avoided: <hi>But as a Father pitieth his own Children, even ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> that is, <hi>Who do not willingly diſpleaſe him,</hi> Pſal. 103.13.</p>
            <p>In a word, As the Pardon of Sins, whether great, or ſmall, is a Mercy held out to us only in the Covenant of Grace, ſo it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us under this very Notion, of being Children of God, as appears
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40806:44"/> from <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. where the Prophet foretels the Happy State of Chriſtians, upon this very Score, in theſe words, <hi>And they ſhall be mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>in that day, when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own Son, that ſerveth him.</hi> And more particularly yet, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.5.7. Forgiveneſs of Sins is there ſpecify'd, as the diſtinct Priviledge of <hi>Adopted Sons,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good pleaſure of his Will; in him we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Thirdly, which is an Appendage to this ſame Priviledge;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> To the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is granted an eaſier Acceſs by Prayer, to the Throne of Grace, for Pardon of Sins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercies.</note> 
               <hi>A Child of God,</hi> upon the Score of ſuch his Relation, is permitted to have an eaſy Acceſs to the Throne of Grace; and is admitted to Addreſs himſelf in Prayer to God, as for whatever other Mercies he ſtands in need of, ſo for Pardon of Sins, when he has Tranſgreſt, with a full Aſſurance of a gracious Anſwer. The Gentiles, who ſerv'd no Gods, but what their own Imaginations created, did it after a Slaviſh manner; for how could they be ſure the Offended Deity was to be Entreated, when he had Reveal'd no ſuch thing unto 'em? And ſo did the Jews alſo, who ſerv'd the True God, it was in a Servile manner too, for when they had committed an Offence againſt the Law, they were to provide their <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and bring it to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and he was to Offer it for 'em, whilſt they ſtood at a diſtance. But now the Veil of the Sanctuary being broke, upon the Death of our High-Prieſt, <hi>We have therefore the Liberty to enter into the Holieſt, by the Blood of Jeſus, by a New and Living way, which he hath Conſecrated for us, through the Veil, that is to ſay, his Fleſh: And having him our High Prieſt over the Houſe of God, we may hence-forward draw near with a true Heart, in full Aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 10.19, 20, 21, 22. that is, Every Chriſtian, provided he comes not with the guilt of any unrepented Sin upon his Conſcience, may himſelf now Offer up his own Prayers to God through Chriſt, without the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of any other Prieſt, or Sacrifice, and that with a full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being graciouſly heard and anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>And that this Faith and full Aſſurance, with which we may Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God, to Pray to him for the Forgiveneſs of Sins, is our Priviledge only, as we are the Sons of God by Adoption, is plain from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto fear, as under the Law, but ye have received the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we cry unto God, Abba Father.</hi> And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe ye are thus made his Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now Laſtly, If there be any other very conſiderable Priviledge,<note place="margin">Laſtly, A Child of God is more ſurely inſtated in the Inheritance of Heaven, than others.</note> accruing to a Child of God, from ſuch his Relation, it is, That, God will more ſurely Inſtate him in the Inheritance of Heaven, than he will do others, that have no ſuch Relation to him: <hi>And,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>if Children</hi> of God, <hi>then Heirs,</hi> we are told. <hi>Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. But the Vaſtneſs of this will be beſt conſider'd by us, when we come to the Explication of that Third, and the laſt of thoſe Priviledges made over to us, on God's Part, in the Covenant of Grace; <hi>viz.</hi> What it is <hi>Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>He Adopted us to be his Children according to the good Pleaſure of his Will.</hi> This Priviledge, that we ſhould be his Children, is Attended with very rich Advantages, all which have accru'd to us, not from any Merit and Deſert of ours, being ſuppos'd Enemies unto him; but only from his free Goodneſs towards us, which was pleas'd ſo to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. And as it is both Great and Free, we ought certainly, with all poſſible Acknowledgments, to Magnify and Extol, both his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Condeſcenſion and Goodneſs, and our owa unſpeakable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Dignity therein. <q>Indeed, for God to be a Father by Creation and Providence (as One obſerves) tho' it be a Mercy, yet it is no Priviledge; for in that Sence he is <hi>Parens rerum,</hi> the common Parent of all things: But, that God ſhould be thy Father by Adoption, that he ſhould make thee his Son, through his only Begotten Son, that he ſhould rake up Dirt and Filth, as thou art, and lay it in his Boſom; that he ſhould take Aliens and Strangers near unto himſelf, and Adopt Enemies and Rebels into his Family: Regiſter their Names in the Book of Life, make them Heirs of Glory, Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt, his Eternal Son, as the Apoſtle doth admiringly re-count it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</q> This is Mercy and Miracle both. It is, indeed, an invaluable Grace and Favour, that we ſhould be Adopted his Children, were it only for this, that he will be ready to Pardon our Sins and Infirmities, and will Admit us favourably to Addreſs, our Selves, and Prayers to him. But this Priviledge of being his Children will farther appear, to be beyond all Expreſſion, Great, ſince, if Children, as the Apoſtle infers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. then Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt; If a <hi>Child of God,</hi> then, which Crowns all the reſt of his Covenanted Mercies, <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which yet, it is ſaid we ſhall be; But what, and how Great that Third, and Laſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Covenant is, I am in the Explication of the next Article to declare unto you.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40806:46"/> Laws, and propoſing to us moſt Encouraging Rewards in Heaven, to ſtir us up to a diligent Obſervance of 'em.</p>
            <p>It is this happy State of Things, under the Title of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> whoſe near approach <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt foretold in the Wilderneſs, ſaying, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> that is, the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the State of the Goſpel, whoſe Great, Fundamental, and Gracious Law, is this, that all Sinners muſt Repent 'em of all their former Sins, and upon their Repentance they ſhall have moſt Eminent Mercies, beſtowed upon 'em. And it was this State alſo, concerning the undue Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which by the Scribes and Phariſees, our Saviour complain'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. ſaying, that <hi>From the days of John the Baptiſt, even till then, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffered Violence, ſo that the Violent took it by force;</hi> that is, the Publicans, and Sinners, and Gentiles, who were look'd upon by the Jews, as thoſe, who had no right to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo as violent Perſons, as Invaders and Intruders, did croud into the Church at the Preaching of the Goſpel, whilſt the Scribes and Phariſees ungratefully and proudly ſtood off.

And ſo likewiſe in ſeveral other Parables of the like Nature, by the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is to be underſtood the ſtate of the Goſpel here on Earth; which ſure does ſhew the exceeding great Dignity, Worth and Excellency of the Goſpel State, far beyond any other Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, either Patriarchal, or Moſaical, which the World had ever Receiv'd from Heaven before.</p>

So that we may ſafely ſay, That as an Heir is One, whoſe Eſtate is not precariouſly depending upon the

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovenanted Goodneſs of God,</hi> for his hopes of Heaven and Happineſs; but he is One, to whom God through Chriſt, has vouchſafed to grant a Legal Claim and Title thereto, by giving his ſolemn Promiſe, and engaging his Truth for the Performance, that he will infallibly beſtow upon him the moſt unſpeakable Joys of Heaven, provided he ſwerves not from his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Obedience to him, but Renouncing all God's Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, will Believe in him, and Obey him truly and faithfully all the days of his Life.</p>
            <p>I do ſay, (and pray mark it) That God, <hi>through Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is through Chriſt alone, not owing to the Merit of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we are Intitled to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to grant us a Legal Claim and Title to this Inheritance; for ſo it is ſaid, that we are Heirs <hi>through Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 4.7. And far be it from any to imagine, that there is any thing of Merit, or Worth in our imperfect Obedience, whereby of it ſelf it ſhould deſerve ſuch a precious Inheritance. It would be an Arrogance and Preſumption in the higheſt Saint, that ever liv'd, and ſuch as would render him more liable to be puniſht for his Pride, than rewarded for his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhould he pretend to Claim Heaven, meerly upon the Score of his own Sanctity; or ſhould he pretend a Claim and Title to the Inheritance of Heaven at all, otherwiſe than <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> and becauſe God has promis'd it. However, ſince God has been pleas'd to Enſure it to us by Covenant, we may ſafely call it a Right, which God, who is Faithful in all his Promiſes, and Juſt in all his Dealings, will never debar us of; except by our Diſloyalty and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him, we forfeit all Right and Title to it.

It is the Priviledge of an Heir, that he has all the Security, that the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Honeſt Perſon, and the Solemnities of a Covenant can give him, to make him a Title; but when the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is the Poſſeſſion, and when he, who cannot deceive, has ſolemnly ſetled

And his Hope being thus built, not upon uncertain Conjectures, but upon the expreſs Promiſes of God, who cannot lie; there is no Temptation ſo alluring, nor Suffering ſo great, that ſuch a Hope will not be able to overcome;<note place="margin">And being ſuch, there is no Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo alluring, nor Suffering ſo great, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.</note>

Thus certain are the Chriſtians hopes of Heaven, it being Inſtated upon him, as an Inheritance.

            <p>I Have already Expounded thoſe infinitely Gracious and Invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Priviledges,</hi> made over to us, on God's Part, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; having ſhew'd you, what it is to be a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt,</hi> what it is to be a <hi>Child of God,</hi> and laſtly, what to be an <hi>Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> as alſo, what are the vaſt Benefit contain'd in thoſe ſeveral Articles; I am now come to Explain to you likewiſe the <hi>Conditions</hi> of the Covenant; thoſe Conditions, without the Performance of which, thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will not be Confer'd on us.</p>
            <p>For this we muſt ſeriouſly conſider, that the Benefits now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to be made over to us, as they are in themſelves exceeding great, ſo as almoſt to equal us with the Bleſſed Angels; and as they were purchas'd for us at no leſs a Rate, than the precious Blood of the Son of God; ſo we muſt not expect that Benefits ſo infinitely great, and dearly Purchas'd, ſhall be Confer'd upon us, without any thing to be done on our Parts, to expreſs our Value of them; much leſs if we continue in Rebellion againſt God, and inſtead of him, ſerve under his Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; or will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Unbelievers, and will remain Diſobedient to all his moſt Juſt and Righteous Commands. No, it is not to be imagin'd, that God will be ſo Eaſy, ſo fond of Sinners, as would reflect upon the Wiſdom and Diſcretion of a meer Man. But as he does propoſe to us <hi>Invaluable Bleſſings,</hi> ſo he does require from us a <hi>Reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the Performance of moſt Equitable Conditions; amongſt which, this is the Firſt, that we ſhould <hi>Renounce</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as I have already Explain'd to you the Importance of thoſe vaſt <hi>Favours on God's part;</hi> ſo I will proceed now to do the ſame, as to thoſe <hi>Conditions on ours,</hi> ſhewing you</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What it is to Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whereof the Firſt is, to Renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh.</note> 
               <hi>the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is as much Matter as can poſſibly be crowded into ſo few Words. A great Part of the Chriſtian Life is diſcharged in what theſe Words do mean: For our Chriſtian Race is repreſented in Scripture to be for the moſt part a Warfare againſt ſeveral very Powerful Enemies, both without and within us. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40806:50"/> theſe Words do Inſtruct you both what thoſe Enemies are, and how we muſt War againſt them. Wherefore, if in the Explication of Words ſo very full of Meaning, and of ſuch vaſt Concernment to be underſtood by you, I ſhall be forc'd to run out into ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Length, you muſt have Patience, and you muſt give good heed to what I ſhall Diſcourſe upon them, anſwerable to the Benefit, may accrue to you from the through underſtanding thereof. That which I ſhall do towards the Explication of them, ſhall be this;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>I will ſhew you who the Devil is, and what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how abſolutely neceſſary it is we ſhould do ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I will alſo ſhew you what is meant by the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this wicked World, and how far you muſt Renounce the wicked World, with its Pomps and Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>I will in like manner, open unto you, what is to be underſtood by the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and how far we muſt Renounce them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Firſt, <hi>I am to ſhew you who the Devil is, what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary it is we ſhould do ſo.</hi>

                  <hi>II.</hi> Such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs more of the Devil's Temper, than others, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride.</note> 
               <hi>which may be more particularly ſtiled the Works of the Devil, are thoſe, which Expreſs more of the very Natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan, than others:</hi> And ſuch are <hi>Pride, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> That <hi>Pride</hi> is the very Temper of Satan, may be gather'd from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. He was Tempted by that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Condition, in which he was Created, to conceive highly of his own Dignity, and Greatneſs, and Merits; and to have tow'ring and ambitious Thoughts of Uſurping to himſelf a greater Power, and larger Province, perhaps, than God had given him; and for this his Pride (and his Rebellion the Effect of it) he was caſt out of Heaven, and Excluded the Bleſſed Manſions of the <hi>Poor in Spirit, whoſe is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.3. And it does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concern every One of you, to take care of harbouring in your Breaſts the leaſt Degrees of Pride and Vanity, and of being Exalted in your own Minds, upon the account of any thing, you Enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, whether a more flouriſhing Condition in the World, or greater Succeſs in your Affairs, or upon the account of your greater Skill and Knowledge, <hi>Leſt, being lifted up with Pride, you fall into the Condemnation of the Devil,</hi> as it is in the now cited Place of <hi>Timothy.</hi> And indeed <hi>Pride,</hi> in whatever ways it ſhews it ſelf, ought moſt carefully to be Subdu'd and Mortify'd, as a Sin moſt truly <hi>Diabolical;</hi> for it is to be conſider'd, That tho' the Devil be the firſt Author of all Sin, and inſtigates to every Kind, yet there are many, which Satan himſelf cannot commit: As for Inſtance, He cannot be Drunk, nor commit Lewdneſs, and the like, himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are committed only in, and by the Body, whereas he is a Spirit; but yet he is Naturally Proud and Ambitious: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' thoſe other, as being more viſible and ſenſible, are more Scandalous in the Eyes of Men; yet this more Spiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride and Ambition, and a Pharaſaical Cenſoriouſneſs, and Thinking more Highly of One-ſelf, and more Diſreſpectfully of Others, than is meet, are more truly <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and have more in their Nature of the Devil's Temper.</p>
            <p>And as Pride, ſo <hi>Envy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Envy.</note> is another of the Devils Qualities. The Devil, through his Pride and Rebellion, having loſt that high Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Dignity, he once enjoy'd in Heaven; and ſeeing Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a Capacity of obtaining a Share in that Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from which he is excluded: He is poſſeſt with the utmoſt Envy both towards God and Man; Envying God the Service of us his Creatures, and us both the Happineſs of ſerving ſo Good a Maſter,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40806:52"/> and thoſe infinite Rewards, which will be given us, for our faithful Service and Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>And from this his Envy proceeds that Rancourous <hi>Malice</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malice.</note> alſo, wherewith he is ever ſince Acted, ſo as to be continually Contriving how to do us the greateſt Miſchief; from whence he is called our <hi>Adverſary, the Devil,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. Envy and Malice are indeed the very Natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan; ſo that he ſeems to be wholly made up thereof. 'Twas Pride, as One ſaid, made him Envious, his Envy, that made him Spiteful and Malicious, all which together make him a <hi>Devil.</hi> And therefore, as you would not appear to have ſomething Diabolical in your very Natures, <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking be put away from you with all Malice; and be Kind one to another, Forgiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, even as God, for Chriſt's Sake, hath Forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.31, 32.</p>

He was a Murderer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> He delights in humane Gore; and no doubt the vaſt Slaughters of Men, which have been made in Bloody Wars, have been through the Inſtigation of Satan, ſtirring up Ambitious Princes unjuſtly to Invade their Neighbours Countries, that he might Glut his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite with Blood: And for the ſame Reaſon he Oblig'd the Pagans, his Worſhipers, to offer Men in Sacrifice to him. And there is no Duel fought, but he is firſt at the making of the Challenge, and then at the Murderer's Elbow to direct the fatal Thruſt. In theſe laſt ſort of Murders, he hopes to do Two Works at once, to deſtroy both Body and Soul in one inſtant; and to be ſure he will never fail being preſent, where he can, to all Intents and Purpoſes, ſo effectually do the work of a <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> as he is ſtyl'd, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.11.</p>

            <p>Secondly, We ſhould proceed to conſider that other great Work of Satan, his Tempting of us to Sin.

                  </gap> Mankind.</note>And agreeably therefore to the Explication now given of the Devil. <hi>To Renounce the Devil,</hi> is, no doubt, to Diſclaim his Uſurpt Dominion and Authority; or to leave off having any Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Agreement with him, or having any Hand in his baſe and ungrateful Rebellion againſt God.</p>
            <p>This was, no doubt, what the Primitive Church underſtood by Renouncing the Devil, (for they are Words of a very ancient Uſe in the Church of God.) The Devil, at the firſt Riſe of Chriſtianity eſpecially, had obtain'd a Viſible Kingdom, and that a Univerſal Monarchy, in a manner, over the World: Hence he is call'd, <hi>The Prince of this World,</hi> Joh. 14.30. He had alſo his Temples, and his Altars, and his Sacrifices. <hi>The things, which the Gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice unto Devils, and not unto God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. As alſo many lewd and bloody Plays, and pompous Proceſſions were made in Honour of him, and he was therefore in Effect, <hi>The God of this world,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. And now, when any were Converted from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, the Primitive Chriſtians did expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, from all, that were Admitted into that <hi>Kingdom of God, the Church of Chriſt,</hi> a publick and open <hi>Renunciation,</hi> or Abjuration of him, or an utter Diſowning and Abandoning the Devil's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and the Paying any Homage, Service, or Obedience to him, by Worſhiping of him, or his wicked Angels, or by going to thoſe Plays and Proceſſions Inſtituted in Honour of him. Thus does <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> an ancient Father, inform us in his Book <hi>De Corona,</hi> wherein reciting the ancient Cuſtoms of the Church, he tells us, <hi>That juſt before any were Baptized into the Chriſtian Religion, they made a ſolemn Profeſſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquam adituri, ibidem, ſed aliquanto prius in Eccleſia, ſub Antiſtitis manu conteſtamur nos Renuntiare Diabolo, &amp; Pompae, &amp; Angelis ejus. <hi>Tertul. de Corona.</hi>

               <hi>both at their Entrance into the Water, as alſo a little before they had done, when under the Biſhop's Hands, that they did Renounce the Devil, his wicked Angels, and Pomps;</hi> that is, thoſe ſolemn Proceſſions of the Heathen Gods, and thoſe Lewd and Cruel Plays, us'd amongſt the Pagans, which were the Ceremonies of State, as it were, in Satan's Kingdom. All ſubjection to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and all uſage of thoſe Rights of his Kingdom, they did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandon and forſake. And this was what was meant in the Primitive Times by <hi>Renouncing of the Devil.</hi>

               <hi>And to Renounce his works of Sin,</hi> muſt accordingly ſignify in their Sence, to diſclaim, abandon, or forſake every Sin, as being the proper Service of the Devil; and in the real Meaning of it, no leſs than a throwing off God's Authority, and a diſowning his Power. For if you will read over <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. you will find, that People upon their forſaking of the True God, to ſerve other Gods, (which were many of 'em at leaſt, no other than Devils) did thereupon fall into all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs, as you will ſee largely deſcrib'd in that Chapter. And if you will alſo look into the Sixth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ver. 11. you will ſee, that Chriſtians by being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40806:53"/> 
               <hi>Were to reckon themſelves to be dead unto Sin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that in the Original, and firſt meaning of the Words, as to Renounce the Devil, was to abjure and diſclaim the Power and Dominion of Satan, and to leave off having any Communication, or Agreement with him, and any Hand in his baſe and ungrateful Rebellion againſt God; ſo to Renounce his Works of Sin, was to Diſclaim, Abandon, or Forſake all, and every Sin, as being the proper Service of the Devil; and in the real Meaning of it, no leſs than a throwing off God's Authority, and a diſ-owning of his Power. This, I ſay, was the firſt Meaning of the Words, in the firſt Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>Nor are they to be Interpreted in a much different Sence at this Day. For Satan has his Kingdom ſtill in the World,<note place="margin">The Words are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in much the ſame Sence at this day; Satan having his Kingdom ſtill in the World, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and the Laws of Sin, which are the Laws of his Kingdom, being ſtill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd by the greateſt Part of Mankind.</note> and the Laws of Sin, which are the Laws of that his Kingdom, are Obey'd by the greateſt Part of Mankind. The Barbarous Nations amongſt the Pagans, do directly ſerve him at this Day; and it is many a Chriſtian's Lot, who is caſt amongſt 'em to be forced, either to Join with 'em in ſuch Impious Service, or to ſuffer Death with Torments, for refuſing. And even in the Chriſtian Pale, tho' his Power is much weaken'd here, ſince the Coming of our Saviour, to what it was before, yet ſtill, as Chriſt has his Church, ſo Satan has his <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> amongſt us; and too many there are, within the Limits of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who do openly and avowedly Obey no other, than the Laws of his Kingdom. All your <hi>Atheiſts and Deiſts, who Blaſpheme God, and the Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and all your Profane Swearers and Curſers, whom you ſhall hear every Hour in the Day to Dare God, as it were, by their horrid Oaths and Imprecations to Damn 'em, that is, to ſend 'em to the Devil; and all thoſe, who Reſort to Charmers, and Conjurers, and Fortune-tellers (as many Thouſands do in this Nation:) All theſe, I ſay, are the open and profeſt Subjects of <hi>Satan's Kingdom.</hi> And how many Lewd and Riotous Livers are there amongſt us, who do little elſe but the Works of the Devil, and Obey no other Laws, but thoſe of Sin? So that as you will <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> in that Sence, wherein the Church does at preſent underſtand the Words, you are with all poſſible care to avoid being of the Number of ſuch Men.</p>
            <p>And I know no more that need be ſaid at preſent,<note place="margin">This Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation for the moſt Part the ſame with Repentance.</note> to explain the Importance of the words, <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be this; That if we conſider ſuch a <hi>Renunciation,</hi> as the Act of One, who has been heretofore a Slave to Satan, and a Servant to Sin, then it ſignifies to Forſake and Abandon the Service of Sin and the Devil, formerly Liv'd in; and ſo being a Ceaſing to do Evil, and a Learning to do well, is the ſame with Repentance. But if it be the Act of One of thoſe, who may be ſaid to need no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of which ſort are Infants, who have never committed <hi>Actual Sin,</hi> then to <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> does mean a firm Reſolution, never to ſide with him in his Rebellion againſt God; and as carefully as he can, to avoid the committing of any Sin, as being that, whereby God's <hi>Rightful Authority</hi> is caſt off, and the Devil's <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpt Dominion</hi> ſubmitted to. And ſo much for the Meaning of <hi>Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works.</hi>

               <hi>And ſo likewiſe muſt his Works of Sin.</hi> Sin as Sin, is entirely Evil: Conſider it in its Original Cauſe and Nature, and conſider it in its Effects and Conſequents, and there is not a worſe Evil in the World than Sin: View it in its Original and firſt Cauſe, and it is a Brat of the Devil's, the Firſt-born of Hell. And view it again in its Nature, and it is a Chooſing of quite other Ends, than what the Wiſe and Good God has Appointed us, and ordain'd us for; and is a Going quite croſs to thoſe Laws and Rules, which he has given us. And then conſider it next in its ſad Effects and Conſequents, and there is no Evil in the World to be Compar'd to it. <q>It is a Sin, ſays One, which turn'd glorious Angels into hideous Devils, and tumbl'd them down from Heaven, to Hell: It is Sin, that fill'd the the World with Woes and Plagues, brought Death and Diſeaſes, and a vaſt and endleſs Summ of Miſeries into it. It is Sin, that torments and terrifies the Conſcience, that kindles Hell Flames, Expoſes the Soul to the eternal and direful Revenges of the great God: And in a word, Sin is ſo perfectly and only Evil, that the worſt of Things here, were they free from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion and Evil of Sin, would be Excellent and Amiable.</q> So that Sin alſo is <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely to be Renounc'd by us;</hi> and there is no one Sin, nothing in the leaſt of Sin, that may willingly be comply'd with.</p>

Nay ſo abſolutely an Evil is Sin, and ſo <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely it is to be Renounc'd by us,</hi> that the leaſt Sinful Action is not to be committed in order to attain the greateſt Good. So little a Sin, as an <hi>Officious Lie,</hi> muſt not be told, no not to ſave a Man's Life: Nor a <hi>Pious Fraud,</hi> nor a <hi>Holy Cheat</hi> committed to promote the Good of the Church, and to Secure and Propagate what we take to be the True

So that every Chriſtian muſt <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely Renounce the Devil, and all his Works of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is but to conſider,<note place="margin">And indeed if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Satan, and of Sin, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of yielding to either, be well conſider'd, it is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and entirely to Renounce both.</note> as well as know the Nature of Satan, and of Sin, and the horrid Conſequence of yielding to either of them; and it is impoſſible any ſhould not Abſolutely and Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Renounce, that is, utterly Deteſt, and Avoid, and Beware of them. As for the Devil, why? Even the Perverſeſt of People, the Iſraelites, when it was ſolemnly put to their Reaſon and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who to ſerve, God, or the Devil, could not without the utmoſt Deteſtation think of the latter. <hi>If it ſeems Evil unto you,</hi> ſays <hi>Joſhua</hi> to them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15, 16. <hi>to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve; whether the Gods of the Amorites, in whoſe Land ye dwell,</hi> (and thoſe Gods were no other than Devils) <hi>but as for me, and my houſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was, <hi>That the People anſwered and ſaid, God forbid, that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other Gods.</hi> God forbid: The very Thoughts of ſuch a Thing, when they came to Conſider it, was Odious to them.</p>
            <p>And if we did but Conſider the odious Nature of Sin, we ſhould not more Abhor the Devil himſelf, than Abandon every Sin: For why? <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil,</hi> we are told 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. Such a One is of the Devil's Party, he is a Sharer in the Devil's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, and in his wicked Deſigns to deſtroy God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And tho' he be not a Devil himſelf, yet he is near A-kin to him, and ſhall Partake with him, as in his Rebellion, ſo in his Puniſhment: And who, that Conſiders this, can ſtick Entirely to Abandon and to Abhor ſo foul a Thing as Sin is?</p>
            <p>But however, whether People will Conſider it or no,<note place="margin">However this if we do not do, we ſhall forfeit all Right and Title to thoſe infinite Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings held forth in the Covenant of Grace.</note> ſo neceſſary it is, that every Chriſtian ſhould abſolutely and entirely Renounce the Devil, and all his Works of Sin; that this if you do not do, you will forfeit all your Right and Title to thoſe infinite Bleſſings, held forth to you in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and Purchas'd for you by the Blood of Chriſt. If you do not utterly Renounce the Devil, by having nothing to do with him in his foul Rebellion againſt God, you will be accounted no <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> as the Apoſtatizing Gnoſticks, thoſe great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God are call'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. and that for their Halting betwixt God and Satan.

               <hi>THE Tenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works.</head>
            <p>I Have already ſhew'd you, Firſt, who the Devil is, and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Part, what are his Works. All <hi>Sin</hi> whatſoever, I have ſhew'd you, is a <hi>Work of the Devil;</hi> but there are ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins, which being more directly level'd againſt God's Authority, and expreſſing more of the natural Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Satan, and being more his own Practice, than others, do more particularly deſerve the Title and Character of the <hi>Works of the Devil;</hi> and what they are I have ſhew'd you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>And as Sin, ſo his Tempting of us to Sin is another main and principal Work of the Devil.</hi> And I have reſerv'd this Subject of Satan's Temptations, to be particularly handled in ſome ſet Diſcourſes by themſelves, that ſo I might have more room to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'em to you; there being no ſubject in Practical Divinity of greater Conſequence and Concernment to our Souls, than to be throughly Informed in the Ways and Methods of Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now to Tempt one,</hi> in the general Notion of the Word,<note place="margin">To Tempt, is to make a Tryal of a Perſon.</note> 
               <hi>does barely ſignify to make Tryal of a Perſon, either by Words, or Signs, by Promiſes, or Threats, whether or no he will do ſuch a thing.</hi> And the Tempting of a Perſon may be Morally Good, or Evil, according to the End, for which ſuch a Tryal is made. If the Tryal be of a Perſon's <hi>Vertue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To Tempt, a thing morally Good or Evil, according to the End thereof.</note> only that Occaſion may be afforded him to give an Experiment and Proof thereof: that ſo if he do well, he may be Rewarded; if Ill, that his <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and the Corruption of his Heart may be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he himſelf Humbled with the Sight and Sence thereof to his Amendment. There is nothing may hinder a Governour eſpecially, thus to Tempt any one; and therefore to Tempt a Man to this End,<note place="margin">To Tempt a Perſon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prove his Vertue, or diſcover his Corruption, conſiſtent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Juſtice, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of a Governour; and thus God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And Firſt we find, <hi>That God Tempted Abraham to try his Faith, and to Reward him for it.</hi> And he did it to as high a degree, as was ever heard of, bidding him to <hi>Take his Son, his only Son Iſaac, whom he loved, and to get him into the Land of Moriah, and to offer him there for a Burnt Offering,</hi> Gen. 22.12. The Tryal was ſevere enough; but God did put <hi>Abraham</hi> upon it with no other deſign, but that he might have occaſion given him to exerciſe his Faith in God. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40806:56"/> by giving ſuch a Noble Demonſtration thereof, as to Reſign up his own Son to be Sacrificed at God's Command, and with his own Hands too,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Thus he Tempted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham to try his Faith, &amp; to Reward him for it.</note> he might thereby Teſtify both to God and Man, how much he Truſted in his Maker; and thereupon might obtain the Honour upon Earth, to be accounted the Father of the Faithful, among all Generations of Men; and in Heaven, to be the Higheſt in the Ranks of all Humane Inhabitants, it being the Priviledge of the greateſt Saints to be Lodg'd in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. And to the ſame Gracious Purpoſes it is, that he does <hi>Tempt</hi> his Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when at any time he lets looſe the Enemy of the Church upon 'em, to perſecute and deſtroy 'em: It is to the Intent, that giving an extraordinary Proof of their Faith, and Conſtancy, and Patience, and Love to him, he may extraordinarily Reward 'em. <hi>Every one that hath forſaken Houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for his Names ſake, being certain to receive an Hundred Fold, and to Inherit everlaſting Life,</hi> Matth. 19.29.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> Hezekiah, to diſcover his Hypocriſy, and to Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in the ſight thereof.</note>Secondly, We find, <hi>That God Tempted Hezekiah, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him his own Hypocriſy and Corruption, and the Pride of his own Heart, that he might be humbled in the Sight and Sence thereof.</hi> For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being lately Recover'd from a mortal Sickneſs, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Providence of God: <hi>The Princes of Babylon ſent their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors unto him to enquire of the Wonder, that was done in the Land, and God left him to try him, that he might Know all that was in his Heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. that is, God did Providentially order the Coming of thoſe Forreign Ambaſſadors upon this Errand, to try <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whether he would take this occaſion before thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who put their Truſt in thoſe, which were no Gods, to Glorify the True God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſo miraculouſly Recovering of him. But he being more Intent upon ſetting out his own Grandeur, than God's Glory, took care only <hi>To ſhew them all the Houſe of his precious Things, the Silver, and the Gold, and the Spices, and the precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the houſe of his Armour, and all the houſe of his Treaſures,</hi> 2 Kings 20.13. Upon which God did ſeverely Reprove and Humble him by the Mouth of his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ver. 17, 18, 19. for ſuch his Ingratitude, Pride, and Vanity. And ſo it is with every One of us. There is a great deal of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> and other <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>ſecret Hypocriſies,</hi> which ly lurking in our Hearts; and we our ſelves are Ignorant thereof, and how we ſhall prove till we are try'd, and ſome Providential Occaſion draws it out: And then if God's Word, or Miniſters, or the Rebukes of our own Conſciences make us ſenſible thereof, we are much Better'd, and God has his Gracious Ends in our Amendment. So that thus you ſee to what gracious Ends God does <hi>Tempt</hi> us; namely, Either to <hi>prove our Vertue,</hi> that he may Reward us the better for it, or to <hi>diſcover our Hypocriſy</hi> and Inſincerity, that we might be Humbled in the Sight and Sence thereof, and be thereby amended.</p>

They give us an Opportunity of Exerciſing the Nobleſt Vertues of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40806:56"/> Faith, and Patience, and ſuch exalted Strains, and glorious Heights of Religion, as cannot be Exerciſed but in a State of Temptation and Tryal: and conſequently they give us an Opportunity of Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up to our ſelves the greateſt Rewards in Heaven, which we ſhall be ſure to Obtain, if we come off clearly and innocently from under Temptation; it being declared, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. that <hi>Bleſſed is the Man, that endureth Temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to thoſe, that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if they are Tryals for the Diſcovery of our Corruptions, they prick the Bladder of <hi>Vanity,</hi> let out the Corruption, and we become better, and ſounder for it ever after. Theſe Tryals of us are not made by God for his own better Satisfaction and Knowledge of us, for he is the <hi>Searcher of the Hearts,</hi> and the <hi>Tryer of the Reins,</hi> and <hi>Knows what is in Man:</hi> But for our own <hi>Conviction,</hi> and the Diſcovery of us and our own Sinfulneſs, to our ſelves, than which Knowledge nothing certainly can be more uſeful to us. To ſuch gracious Ends you ſee are God's Temptations, which are not therefore in any ſence to be Renounc'd by us. Well, But</p>

No, the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are made to this End, do ariſe from other Authors than God; either from our own Luſts, and ſo it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Every Man is Tempted, when he is drawn aſide of his own Luſts, and Enticed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon puniſhed for this Tranſgreſſion is Wicked &amp; Malicious; and ſo the Devil, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the World, and the Fleſh, do Tempt us.</note> Jam. 1.14. Or from the World, particularly from wicked Perſons in it: And thus the <hi>whoriſh Woman</hi> Tempted the <hi>young Fool,</hi> Prov. 7.18. Or chiefly and originally from Satan: Hence in many Places of the Scripture, particularly <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. he is ſtyl'd <hi>the Tempter;</hi> and from his unwearied Diligence in Tempting us, he is ſaid to be continually <hi>walking about ſeeking whom he may Devour.</hi> He is here by way of Eminence call'd the Tempter, becauſe he is the Chief of all thoſe Enemies of ours, which would withdraw us into Sin. He is the grand Engineer, that puts the World, and the Fleſh on work, that does Order and Appoint which way they ſhall Batter us, and does Direct and Manage their ſeveral Temptations.</p>
            <p>And now,<note place="margin">The vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment it is to us, to know his Temptations.</note> as it does infinitely concern you to Know his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in what Ways and Methods he uſually Tempts Men, <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage over you:</hi> So by the Help of God, I will diſcover to you his manifold Policies and Wiles; for tho' he be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Spirit, and his ways alſo are not always viſible to mortal Eyes; yet through the Diſcoveries, that God has made to us in his Holy Scripture, <hi>we are not Ignorant of his Devices,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.11. And I do think they may all of them, in a manner, be Reduc'd to theſe Four Heads.</p>

This he did in Corrupting our Firſt Parents; Knowing, that if the Fountain were Poiſon'd, all the Streams that Iſſue thence, muſt needs run muddy and defiled, as it accordingly happen'd: For <hi>By that One Man Sin Enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>

And what, tho' you may Eat of all the Trees but One, why not of every Tree? Why ſhould a Man's Appetites be reſtrain'd from any Thing that is delightful in this World? But however you need not be afraid, for tho' God does deal ſo hardly with you, as to deny you thoſe proper Enjoyments you might take; yet it cannot be, that he will deſtroy you for your Diſobedience in ſo reaſonable a caſe. He will be more favourable to you in the End, however he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens you now.

This is One of the more General Policies of Satan, whereby he did at firſt, and does ſtill endeavour to draw all Mankind, to venture upon a Revolt from God.</p>
            <p>But whatever Conceits of this Kind do at any time enter into your Hearts, you are to Renounce and Abhor,<note place="margin">But all ſuch Conceits of God, are to be utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd and caſt out of our Thoughts, as Diabolical Suggestions, moſt deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive to our Souls.</note> and immediately to caſt them out of your Thoughts, as the undoubted <hi>Suggeſtions of Satan,</hi> on purpoſe to take off your Fears, and to lull your Souls into a moſt dangerous ſecurity in a Courſe of Sin. No ſure, the Laws of God, which he has given us, you muſt conſider, are moſt Juſt and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in themſelves; and yet farther to Encourage us to Obey 'em in the moſt difficult Caſes, he has Propounded infinite Rewards in Heaven to thoſe, who ſhall perſevere to the End in well-doing; but on the contrary, to diſcourage Diſobedience, he does Threaten as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and eternal Puniſhments in Hell, to all licentious and wicked Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And as he will not fail of Beſtowing the former, ſo there is no reaſon in the World to fancy he will forbear to Inflict the latter. It was not without the higheſt Reaſon, and perhaps becauſe nothing leſs than Eternal Puniſhments are ſufficient to reſtrain Sinners from thoſe Pleaſures of Sin, which are preſent, that he did Threaten to Inflict ſuch at firſt. And when Laws ſo Reaſonable in themſelves, and whoſe Obedience, neither the Goodneſs of the Lawgiver, in ſo bountifully Rewarding, nor the fear of his Power in ſo terribly Puniſhing, can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, are baſely Tranſgreſt, and Trampled upon by baſe and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rebels againſt the Majeſty of Heaven: what reaſon is there any Sinner ſhould promiſe himſelf, That God will not Puniſh the Trangreſſion of 'em to as high a Degree, as in his Word he has Threaten'd? And for any Man therefore without any Ground at all, but his own ſond Wiſhes and Deſires, he might not be ſo Puniſht, to to Promiſe himſelf, That God will after all forbear him, is ſuch a deſperate Peice of Madneſs, as can never enter into the Hearts of any, but thoſe, whom Satan has Inſatuated and Befool'd to their Ruine and Deſtruction. Wherefore you muſt take care, that you <hi>Abandon, and utterly caſt out of your Souls</hi> the very firſt Motions of ſuch Thoughts, looking upon 'em as no other, than <hi>Suggeſtions from Satan,</hi> whenever they enter into your Minds: And in ſo doing you will <hi>Renounce,</hi> as it highly Concerns you, that Firſt and moſt dangerous Temptation of Satan.</p>

For why? Sin like Mud, does ſtrangely foul and defile the Soul. It ſtirs up the Luſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites within a Man, and theſe riſing upwards, do wonderfully cloud and muddy a Man's Reaſon. Sin does even turn a Man Topſy-turvy. It puts the Affections, Luſts and Appetites uppermoſt and tumbles Reaſon and Judgment down; and therefore, Juſt as in a Veſſel, which has a Sediment in the Bottom, but clear Liquor in the Top, if you turn it up, the Dregs mixing with the purer Part, makes that, which was clear as Chryſtal before, become very foul and muddy: So in a Soul defil'd with Sin, Reaſon can no longer ſee where the Way of its Happineſs does lye.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40806:58"/> committed, will cauſe in them ſuch a Reprobate Mind, as will diſable 'em at length to know any <hi>difference between Good and Evil.</hi>
            </p>

And as to Others, by decoying 'em into one Sin after another, he does at length improve their Knowledge of Evil to that degree, that at laſt they come to know nothing of Good; nay, to have ſo little a ſence of it, ſuch ſtupify'd Apprehenſions concerning it, as to <hi>Call Evil, Good, and Good, Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then having once blindfolded the Reaſon of Man with the Ignorance of Divine Things, what Sin and Miſery is there,<note place="margin">And being ſpiritually ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Men are eaſily led into whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin and Miſery.</note> That Satan does not moſt eaſily lead Men into? For why? Good and Uſeful Knowledge, ſuch as the Knowledge of God and of our ſelves, and of our Duty to him, is the Eye of the Soul, whereby alone it can ſee its Way, and ſteer its Courſe ſafely towards Heaven: Whereas on the other ſide, <hi>Ignorance of God and Religion,</hi> is the ſame in the Mind, as <hi>Blindneſs</hi> in the Eye; and therefore as a Blind man may with the greateſt Eaſe be drawn aſide into Pits, and over Rocks to his Downfal and Deſtruction, and it is next to impoſſible he ſhould ever get ſafe to his Journeys End: ſo an Ignorant Man in Religious Matters muſt needs be an eaſy Prey to Satan and Falſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and he cannot poſſibly tell how to ſteer his Courſe ſafe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, but muſt almoſt neceſſarily ſuffer Ship-wrack of Body and Soul in Hell. So that this Policy of the Devil, in Corrupting the Underſtanding and Reaſon of Man, by putting him upon curious Enquiries, and a ſinful Experiment, in order as he pretended, to enlarge his Knowledge, but in reallity with a deſign to draw over his Soul a thick Cloud of Ignorance, that ſo he might lead him blindfold into into any Sin and Miſery, is a Depth of Satan that was, and ſtill is moſt Fatal and Deſtructive to our Innocence, and to our Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And this therefore is another Wile of Satan's,<note place="margin">This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another Wile of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's, which muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided.</note> which you muſt alſo carefully avoid. You muſt above all things Beware of ever making <hi>Experiments of the Pleaſures of Sin,</hi> vainly deceiving your own Souls with the Expectations, that having once known what is in 'em, you will the more Abhor'em for the future. Few of thoſe, who do make ſuch ſinful Experiments do afterwards return to a ſound, and ſober Senſe of things. Not that they find any reaſon to ſtick to thoſe Courſes, but becauſe the ways of Sin are meer Mazes, which once Enter'd into, are hardly got out of; and becauſe Sin often committed, does at length ſcar the Conſcience, and drives away the Holy Spirit, and ſo the wretched Sinner becomes utterly <hi>Ignorant</hi> of God's Ways and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs therein. <hi>And in their Ignorance</hi> what Pits of Deſtruction are there, which Satan cannot draw them into. You muſt therefore, I ſay, above all things endeavour, as to Expel all <hi>Ignorance of Divine Things</hi> out of your Minds: ſo the great Cauſes thereof, of Satan's Contrivance, namely, <hi>Curioſity after vain and unprofitable Things,</hi> which will divert you from what does infinitely more concern you, <hi>viz.</hi> The good State of your Souls; and you muſt carefully beware

Why, this Satan did, by propoſing to their Senſes ſuch Objects, as being exceedingly Delightful, and extreamly Pleaſant to Behold and Taſt, might moſt eaſily prevail upon them, to Tranſgreſs their Maker's Laws in Obtaining of them.</p>
            <p>And by the very ſame Methods does he prevail to this Day upon the far greateſt part of Mankind to Rebel againſt God.<note place="margin">And by the ſame methods does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, to this day, upon the far greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Rebel againſt God.</note> He was ſo well aſſured of the Efficacy and Power of this Temptation, that he endeavour'd to Overthrow even our Bleſſed Saviour by it. <hi>He takes him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhewing him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the Glory of them, he ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> Matth. 4.8, 9.

In which of theſe ways ſoever it is, that he Attempts you, you muſt ſtoutly Reſiſt him.

Millions, I ſay, of Martyrs and Confeſſors have gone before us in this way of Renouncing the Devil, and his Perſecuting Methods of Tempting: <hi>And the time would fail me to tell, what Tryals they had of cruel Mockings and Scourgings, yea, moreover of Bonds and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how they were Stoned, were Sawn aſunder, were Tempted, were Slain with the Sword; how they wander'd about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, being Deſtitute, Afflicted, Tormented,</hi> Heb. 11.36, 37. And all this they ſuffer'd, rather than they would Deny the Faith, or in the leaſt Comply with Idolatry, or Hereſy, or with any Sin and Wickedneſs, to which Satan and his Inſtruments would have forc'd 'em. And ſo muſt we likewiſe, we muſt all of us in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner utterly <hi>Renounce the Devil, and Reſiſt unto Blood</hi> his Tempting us to Hereſy, or Sin, if call'd thereunto; our Bleſſed Saviour having made it the indiſpenſible Condition of all his Followers ſo to do, Matth. 16.24. <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him Deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi>

            <p>And indeed thoſe are the Happy men, who are Perſecuted for their Adherence to Chriſt and true Religion, againſt Satan and his wicked Inventions. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are Perſecuted for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.10. There Perſecution tends in the End, both to their own greater Reward, <hi>Great is their Reward in Heaven,</hi> ver. 12. And to the farther Increaſe and Propagation of Truth; when the Devil has done his worſt, the True Church of Chriſt, like the <hi>Palm-Tree,</hi> being found to ſpread the wider for being Oppreſt.

I fear, that thoſe who ſo zealouſly decry Forms of Prayer, and that on purpoſe to Advance in its ſtead a more Spiritual way of Worſhip, as they think, will take it ill, that their darling Opinion ſhould be Entituled to the Policy of ſo ill an Author; but, if conſidering the Miſchief, together with the Cunning there does appear upon Examination, to be in Satan's Contrivances to Ruine Religion, and to draw us off from God; we may ſafely Conjecture any Doctrine, that is Pernicious in its Effects, when Plauſible in its Appearance, to be of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And thus you may perceive, by theſe few Inſtances, whereby you may be enabled to make a happy Conjecture concerning the reſt, how Cunningly Satan does Gild over, and Diſguiſe his Errors with ſomething of a Reſemblance to Divine Truth, in order to prevent their Diſcovery: And this he does, eſpecially in thoſe Countries and Churches, where Men do <hi>Thirſt</hi> after Divine Knowledge, and to that End do <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> The Devil's main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Care indeed, is to keep out the Word of God from ſhining upon any People; and at firſt he bends all his Forces to keep off the Preachers of it, that ſo the World being detain'd in Ignorance, they may not know how to Repent and Return to God: But when the Light of his Holy Goſpel does once begin to ſhine upon any People, then all his Endeavours are to Corrupt and Deprave it with falſe and forc'd Explications, and to multiply Controverſies and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religious Matters, to teach Men to Scruple every Thing, and out of a ſcrupulous Humour to divide and ſub-divide into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Sects and Parties, ſtirring up each to Perſecute and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the other; that whilſt the different Parties contend ſo furiouſly

And tho' it be his conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Endeavours, to Exerciſe his utmoſt Enmity againſt the Seed of the Woman, and to Eſtabliſh his Kingdom amongſt Men: Yet to fit his Counſels to proper Seaſons, to ſuit 'em to the ſeveral Ages of the Church, to the Studies, and Diſpoſitions, and Occupations of Men, that ſo he may commit no Blunder in his Politicks, is his great and mighty Care and Cunning. Of which, amongſt other Inſtances that might be given, I will chooſe but One.</p>
            <p>In the dark and ignorant Ages of the Church, which were from about the Ninth Century, till towards the Time of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Men's Studies and Diſpoſitions ſavour'd wholly of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;</hi> we hear of nothing ſo much in the Stories of thoſe Times,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40806:64"/> as of the Apparitions and Viſions,<note place="margin">Hence in dark and ignorant Ages, nothing ſo common as the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Saints, as was pretended to introduce the belief of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the like Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that the Founders of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Orders, and ſuperſtitious Doctrines did receive: Inſomuch, that no New Order of Monks and Fryars, nor any New Doctrine of Purgatory, Image-worſhip, Prayers to Saints, or any Pilgrimage to the Shrine of ſome Saint departed, was to be Invented; but either the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or ſome other Saint, is ſaid to have Appear'd, and to have Appointed it. And as Legendary and Fabulous, as were the Hiſtories of thoſe Times, I am apt to Believe there were ſuch Apparitions, as I am throughly perſwaded, that <hi>Samuel</hi> did Appear to <hi>Saul:</hi> But then, as it was not really <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, for his Body was in the Grave, and his Soul in Paradiſe (and it was not in the Power of the <hi>Witch of Endor,</hi> to Raiſe up the One from the Duſt, much leſs to Recal the Other out of Heaven;) but the Devil, who did aſſume <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Shape: So it is more than probable, he might appear in the Reſemblance of the Bleſſed Virgin, and Others, to ſeduce the ſuperſtitious People of thoſe Times into Idolatrous Practices, who throwing aſide the Scriptures, <hi>Gave heed to Fables and Doctrines of Devils.</hi> It was infinitely then the Intereſt of his Kingdom ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But pray Obſerve his different Policies at this Day.<note place="margin">And in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he is as ſhy in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt he ſhould deſtroy the prevailing Sadduciſm.</note> Now we live in a Learn'd and Inquiſitive Age, wherein Men are naturally very ſuſpicious, and not eaſy to Believe what they do not ſee. And therefore partly through ſuch an incredulous Temper of Mind, and partly through a Spirit of Atheiſm and Sadduciſm now Reigning, many, like the Sadducees of Old, will <hi>Believe no Spirits.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we do very ſeldom hear of any Apparition, and the Atheiſt cannot obtain One, tho' he deſires it, and would go many Miles to ſee One. The Reaſon is plain. Should the Devil appear to him, it would convince him there are thoſe <hi>Inviſible Powers,</hi> which now he denies; and therefore Satan, who is ſo Politick, will be as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to appear now, as he was forward then: Becauſe it is as much his Intereſt to detain Men in Atheiſm and Sadduciſm in this, as in Superſtition in former Ages.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> As to the skilfulneſs of the Seedſman, Satan is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choice of fit and proper Inſtruments, and in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Arts of Deceiving, and with ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whom he employs to ſow the Seed of corrupt Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine in the Souls of Men.</note> And that there may be nothing wanting to compleat his Deluſions, <hi>Satan is wonderfully cunning in making choice of fit and proper Inſtruments, and in furniſhing thoſe out, both with all the plauſible Arts of Deceiving, and alſo with ſuitable Qualities, whom he employs to ſow the Tares of corrupt Doctrines in the Souls of Men.</hi> This the Holy Spirit is particularly careful to Inform us of, and to Forewarn us againſt 'em; eſpecially 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. where the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>As Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light</hi> (which he is, when under the plauſible Appearance and Colour of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing God's Honour in ſome of his Attributes, and of ſetting up Goſpel-Truths, as he would have 'em taken to be, he does Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Hereſies, and Vile Practices into the Church; that do moſt effectually undermine God's Authority amongſt Men, and wholly Overthrow all Reverence to him:) So that thoſe Teachers, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, who do Infuſe any of his falſe Doctrines into Men's Hearts, <hi>Are deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are deceitful Workers,</hi> Teaching the Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by Halves, ſometimes Advancing Morality, and a Virtuous
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40806:65"/> Life, with the Neglect, if not with the Contempt of, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to an Orthodox and ſound Faith; ſometimes on the other ſide, placing all Religion in <hi>Believing aright</hi> concerning God and Chriſt, and decrying the Intereſt of Good Works in our <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> before God. And to the End they may be the better fitted to Deceive, he is not wanting to <hi>Furniſh out his Inſtruments with all the moſt plauſible Arts of Deceiving.</hi> And their deceitful Working is uſually in the very ſame manner as the Devil's was. That wicked Spirit would have Tempted our Saviour deſperately to throw himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple, and to preſume upon God's working of a Miracle to preſerve him in ſo doing. And to Encourage him therein, he quotes a Text of Scripture, which is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>For he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, and they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone.</hi> In the Quotation of which Place of Scripture, you may obſerve, he leaves out what makes againſt him, which are theſe Words, <hi>To keep thee in all his Ways.</hi> The Words Entire are, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all his Ways;</hi> meaning, That ſo long as a Man keeps himſelf in the Ways of God, and in the Uſe of thoſe due Means, which he has preſcrib'd; he will not fail to Preſerve him. And in the very ſame manner do moſt Heretical Deceivers delude the World. They will pretend the higheſt Veneration and Reſpect for Scripture, and none are ſo apt to quote it for every Thing they ſay, as they: But then if you obſerve them, they either leave out ſuch Expreſſions, as make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, or conſider not the Scope and Meaning thereof, with reference to the Context and Meaning of the foregoing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, or they put ſome forc'd and violent Interpretation upon 'em, not at all agreeable to the meaning thereof in that Place. Thus they are <hi>deceitful Workers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>They will Transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> putting on the Garb and outward Appearance of Apoſtolick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces, when they go forth into the World to diſperſe theſe their Errors. Indeed Satan is careful to furniſh thoſe, whom he ſends out with <hi>ſuitable and agreeable Qualities,</hi> according to the Nature of thoſe Errors they are to ſow in the World. If their Buſineſs is to undermine the Faith of Chriſtians, to diſparage the more myſterious Doctrines of Chriſtianity, of a <hi>Trinity of Perſons in one Divine Nature,</hi>

            <p>And now there is not a greater Difficulty perhaps in the whole Chriſtian Warfare,<note place="margin">The moſt difficult Part of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Warfare is to preſerve One ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with Heretical Pravity, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd over with the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

The Rule given us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3. whereby to diſcover the Doctrines of Satan's Infuſing, is this; <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the Fleſh, is not of God.</hi> By Jeſus Chriſt being come in the Fleſh, is meant, that Jeſus Chriſt took our Nature upon him, that he might be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40806:66"/> betwixt God and Us, to Reconcile the Father to us, by his Satisfaction and Interceſſion for us. And whoſoever ſhall teach contrary to this, ſo as to take off our Dependance upon Chriſt, let him ſeem never ſo Zealous for a Good Life, his Doctrine is of Satan's deviſing.</p>
            <p>The whole Deſign of Chriſtianity is, no doubt, as appears from theſe Two former Rules, to make us Holy in this World; and yet withal to create in us ſuch a Dependance and Reliance on Chriſt for Salvation, as to expect it, not on the account of our own Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which are ſo Imperfect, but in the Vertue of Chriſt's Mediation with the Father for us. And whoſoever will but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Examine the ſeveral falſe Doctrines, ſo much Preacht up at this Day by our Enemies on either ſide, by theſe Two Rules, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Deſign of Chriſtianity,</hi> I am verily perſwaded, will find moſt of them to thwart one Part, or other of this Deſign; and that either they diſcourage Holineſs, or if they ſeem to ſtand upon the Neceſſity thereof, they decry the Neceſſity of our Dependance upon Chriſt's Mediation for God's Acceptance of it to our Juſtification; and ſo by one, or other of theſe Rules, we may diſcover them to be Doctrines of Satan's infuſing. Moſt of the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do plainly tend to make Men ſecure in a Courſe of Sin; and thoſe <hi>Antinomian</hi> Tenets, wherewith ſome of our Diſſenting Brethren are too much in Love, do alſo tend to the ſame, cauſing us to depend ſo entirely on Chriſt's ſatisfaction, as to make us neglect the <hi>Working out our own Salvation:</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Socinian,</hi> at the ſame time he pretends much for Morality, and a Good Life, denies the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, and that God the Father gave him to be an <hi>Attonement</hi> for the Sins of Mankind, and in the Vertue of his precious Blood to Intercede in Heaven for our Reconciliation; ſo that he wholly takes off our Faith, or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Chriſt for Juſtification. Thus may the moſt dangerous Errors now in the Church of Chriſt, with a little Watchfulneſs and Care to examine the Tendency of them, be diſcovered by you from whoſe Suggeſtions they proceed, and that they are <hi>Tares of the Enemies,</hi> that is, the Devils <hi>ſowing, whilſt the Husbandman was aſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do you, I beſeech you, carefully beware of ſuch falſe Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and deceitful Teachers; both which are Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to draw you unwittingly to ſin againſt, and diſhononr God: And tho' his Agents ſeem never ſo Demure, and appear never ſo Sanctify'd, who do teach Men ſuch Doctrines; <hi>Beware of thoſe Wolves, who come to you in Sheeps cloathing, you ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi> If they ſhall endeavour to inſtill into your Minds any undue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, contrary to what you are taught out of the Scripture in the Doctrine of our Church; or any pernicious Opinions, that in their Nature and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſhall render an Holy, Good Life unneceſſary to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; aſſure your ſelves they are no <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> but of Satan: And are ſet on work by him to deſtroy God's Authority, amongſt Men, and to ſet up his own Laws in their Hearts, the Thing he aims at.

            <p>THE Point that we are now upon, is to make as full a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to you, as here we can, of that Great <hi>Work of the Devil, his Tempting us to Sin:</hi> A Work ſo eminently the Buſineſs and Employment of Satan, and ſo Dangerous and Deſtructive to Mankind, and alſo manag'd in ſuch manifold and cunning Methods, that it ought particularly to be conſider'd by us. <q>The Devil, ſays a Father, has nothing elſe that he does, but Tempt us to Sin; He neither Eats, nor Drinks, nor Sleeps, nor does he any thing elſe but Tempt, Deceive, and Subvert us. This is his Meat, this is his Honour, this is his Joy. In this he is Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable, and if he could have his Will, he would never ceaſe Tempting us, but that he is reſtrain'd by the Power of God.</q>

And therefore we do commonly ſee the Generality, upon any Change, are ready to take up with the Religion, or Tranſcribe the Pattern, and Ape the Actions and Vices of their Prince, or other Governour; and their Faults, as well as Habits, ſhall become the Faſhion of the Country: So that an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Prince, ſhall ſeldom have a Religious People; a Debaucht Nobility and Gentry, a Devout and Orderly Neighbourhood and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40806:67"/> Family; a Wicked Father, Pious Children; or an Evil Maſter, Good Servants: But their Actions have the Force, not only of a Pattern, but alſo of a Rule and Law, which Inferiors and Dependants are affraid to go againſt. So that it is not to be wonder'd, that the Devil ſhould be more than ordinarily induſtrious to gain over to his Party, ſuch as are moſt Eminent for their <hi>Station and Quality.</hi> (One ſuch tall <hi>Cedar</hi> ſweeps away with him in his Fall, all the lower Shrubs within the reach of its Branches.)</p>

But Satan no doubt did intend thereby (however his Deſigns were Over-rul'd by the Divine Providence, as is moſt uſual) to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was in <hi>Labours more abundant, in Stripes above meaſure, in Priſons more frequent,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.23. that is, more Induſtrious in Propagating the Goſpel than others, and came not a Whit <hi>Behind the very Chiefeſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> ver. 5.</p>

And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40806:68"/> thus again was the Son of God himſelf, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and thus very frequently are the ſucceeding Miniſters of Religion Injur'd to this Day. <hi>The Son of Man came Eating and Drinking,</hi> that is, He Affected nothing ſingular, nor differing from other Men in indifferent things, and they ſay, <hi>Behold a Man Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous and a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> Matth. 11.19. On the other ſide, <hi>John came neither Eating, nor Drinking,</hi> uſed extraordinary Faſtings above other Men, <hi>and they ſay he hath a Devil,</hi> ver. 18. And ſo it alſo fares with the ſucceeding Miniſters of Religion. Is any One of a free, cheerful and ſociable Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and does not wholly abſtain from appearing in Company? Then he is a Drunkard. Is he Frugal, and not given to Profuſe Living? Then he is Covetous. Is he Conſcientious in maintaining the Dues of his Church, and will not ſuffer 'em to be Loſt or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the Sacriledge of Covetous Worldlings? Then he is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious and given to Law, he is Covetous, and what not? So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Induſtrious, are Satan and his Agents, to Blacken the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Miniſters of <hi>True Religion,</hi> (I ſay of <hi>True Religion,</hi> for you may always obſerve with what Induſtry the real Vices of thoſe, who are <hi>Miniſters in Hereſy and Schiſm,</hi> are kept ſecret.)

            <p>It does in Truth ſo exceedingly concern the Intereſt of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,<note place="margin">It wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Interest of Religion, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of its Miniſters be kept unſully'd.</note> that the Reputation of its Miniſters ſhould be preſerv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſully'd; and ſo injurious to Religion it ſelf, are the Defamations of ſuch Perſons, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was careful to warn <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>againſt an Elder,</hi> that is, againſt a Miniſter, <hi>He ſhould not receive an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Two, or Three Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.19. Tho' a ſingle Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that was Credible, was ſufficient againſt any other Perſon: But ſo much, on the contrary, it is to the Advancement of Satan's Kingdom,<note place="margin">Hence Satan and Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Men ſo Induſtrious to blaſt it.</note> and ſo Satanically are the greateſt Part of the World diſpos'd, that a vilifying Story, or a ſcandalous Report againſt them is more readily Invented, more eaſily Heard, and ſooner Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, nay, without any Ground at all ſurmis'd, than againſt any other Perſon whatſoever. But let me tell you, that no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that deſires the Deſtruction of Satan's, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Kingdom in the World, will be forward to hear, much leſs to Believe and Propagate Defamations of the Clergy; as knowing it is the Policy of Satan, to put it into the Hearts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Spirits to ſurmiſe, and raiſe, and aggravate little vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stories of thoſe in Holy Orders, as of ſome Indiſcretion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: This to make 'em cheap, and more ſcandalous, and falſe Reports of Debauchery and Immorality, to render 'em Odious in the world; and both on purpoſe to render their Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours uſeleſs and ineffectual, to the Reformation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.<note place="margin">And ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reports leſſen the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Influence of the Clergy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much as real Sin.</note>

            <p>In ſhort: Satan matters it not ſo much, whether by real Sin, or by ſlanderous Reports, he leſſens the Authority and Influence of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> his Avow'd Enemies, whoſe peculiar Buſineſs it is to deſtroy his Uſurpt Dominion, and to Propagate the Kingdom of God in the World. By real Sins indeed, he would rather chooſe, if he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40806:69"/> could, and does therefore mainly Endeavour to have the Clergy Blemiſht; but meerly by raiſing the Scandal, be it as well Falſe, as True, he gains his End, according <hi>Machiavel,</hi> his great Secretary's Maxim, <hi>Fortiter accuſare &amp; aliquid adherebit:</hi> Throw Dirt upon a Man, and the Stain will in ſome meaſure ſtick. Such is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Humour of the World, as to think there muſt be ſomething in it, when a Slander is broacht; and ſo maliciouſly are wicked Men bent againſt the Miniſters of Religion eſpecially, as greedily to ſwallow every thing, that tends to leſſen their Reputation. In a word, By both he gains his End, which is, to have Religion it ſelf wounded, through the ſides of its Miniſters. And whether any of 'em ſhall really miſcarry, or be falſly Defam'd for ſo doing, he knows, the world upon either account will <hi>Abhor the Offerings of the Lord,</hi> and even a meer Slander will be ſuch a ſtumbling Block to many, <hi>As to make the Lord's People to tranſgreſs.</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40806:69"/> he will, whether Miniſter, Magiſtrate, Parent, or Maſter, that goes about to Reprove and Admoniſh others; the Criminal, inſtead of being Convinc'd and Better'd thereby, will preſently Return upon him in Thought at leaſtwiſe, if not in Word, with a Why did you do ſo your ſelf? And now for theſe Reaſons, I ſay, the Devil lays a cloſe Siege againſt a Perſon of Exemplary Piety and Goodneſs. As for thoſe, who are already Vicious, he reckons himſelf ſecure of them; ſo he does not ſo much concern himſelf about them: He only throws a Temptation now and then into their way, leaving 'em for the moſt part to follow the Bent of their own Inclinations: But againſt this <hi>Bulwark</hi> of Religion,<note place="margin">Againſt this Bulwark of Religion, therefore the Devil draws up all his Artillery.</note> a Perſon of bright and ſhining Graces, he draws up all his Artillery, and levels all his Inſtruments of Battery. Thus he attackt Holy <hi>Job,</hi> when he found that Proſperity would not corrupt him, he goes another way to work, and with unheard of Afflictions, one following upon the heels of another, he endeavour'd to force him to Blaſpheme his Maker, and deſperately to <hi>Curſe God and dye.</hi> He is a great Maſter of Politicks, and therefore takes ſuch Meaſures as a Crafty General in the Conqueſt of an Enemies Country. A wiſe Commander will always lye down before the Place of greateſt Conſequence, and upon the taking of which the reſt will fall in of Courſe; ſo the Devil, his great Attempt is to foil an Exemplary Pattern of Religion, whoſe Fall he thinks will ſhrewdly ſtagger many others.</p>
            <p>But the inceſſant Induſtry of Satan to overcome a more than ordinary Piety, and the Pride he takes therein,<note place="margin">The Pride and Pains he takes in overcoming ſuch a One repreſented in a Parable.</note> I cannot better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you, than in the following Parable given us out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. <q>
                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> having ſent forth his Officers to fill the World with Death and Ruine, they all went on their ſeveral Errands: Upon their Return he demands an account of their Proceedings, What Miſchiefs they had done, what Plagues they had ſcatter'd, and what Calamities they had ſent amongſt affrighted Mortals. One of them more forward than the reſt, Replies, He had been a Fortnight wandering about, and at laſt had over-turned ſome Merchant Ships at Sea, inſomuch that both Men and Goods were loſt. The Prince of Darkneſs enrag'd at his Lazineſs, inſtead of a Reward, gave him an Hundred Stripes, becauſe he had done no more hurt all that time. Another Spirit ſtands forth, and boaſts that he had been for a Month together contriving how to ſet ſuch a City on Fire, and had at laſt Effected it, and he alſo was ſeverely Puniſht for his Idleneſs, and neglect of Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſign ſooner. At laſt comes forth a Third, that had been Fourty Years abſent, and being askt how he had promoted the Intereſt of the Black Empire; anſwered, Thoſe Fourty Years have I been Tempting ſuch a Religious Man to Fornication, and have at laſt prevail'd, and at this time he wallows ſecurely in his Sin. <hi>Beelzebub</hi> immediately riſes from his Throne, hugs the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Feind, Embraces the Child of Darkneſs, and with Rhetorick fetcht from Hell, commends him before all the howling Crew, as having done a greater Exploit after Fourty Years Travel, than the other did by Afflicting and Conſuming ſo many Men, Ships, and Houſes in a few Days and Weeks.</q> The Moral and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Fable is no other than this: That if he can make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40806:70"/> Believer, weary of his Heavenly Mindedneſs, and burning Zeal to God's Glory, he values that Piece of Miſchief more than if he Tempted a great many of thoſe, who are already wicked, to greater Impieties. And that not only becauſe of the Pride and Glory he takes in Conquering ſuch a <hi>Heroe</hi> in Chriſtianity, but becauſe to make One, who by his Exemplary Piety and Vertue, was an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtrument in the Advancement of God's Glory, to become by his Revolt from God, as great an Engine in promoting the Kingdom of Darkneſs, is to his Credit and Intereſt both.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In a word, and to ſumm up in ſhort what has been ſpoke on this Point; I have at length ſhew'd you, that next to the Deſtroying and Perverting of whole Churches, the Devil's great Induſtry, is to gain over to his Party; or to Tempt to the Commiſſion of ſome grievous Sin, ſuch Perſons as are more than ordinarily Eminent for their <hi>Rank,</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> their <hi>Order,</hi> or their <hi>Piety,</hi> in the Church of God. And this being ſo; ſince ſuch are the great Mark of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, it concerns thoſe excellent Perſons, who are eminently Great, or Good, that they do eſpecially, and above all other Men <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>entirely,</hi> and <hi>utterly Renounce,</hi> and Reſiſt all and every the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, ſo as not to yield to any of 'em. Such are to look upon themſelves as the <hi>great Commanders in the Church Militant,</hi> who are to lead, and to go before others in the Battles of the Lord againſt Sin and Satan; but if any ſuch ſhould Cowardly <hi>Give back in the day of Battle</hi> and Temptation, they <hi>put a ſtumbling Block, and are an occaſion to fall in their Brothers way,</hi> Rom. 14.13. And what ſays our Saviour in ſuch a Caſe? <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6, 7. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend One of thoſe little Ones, which Believe in him,</hi> that is, diſcourage and drive from the Chriſtian Practice, by his ſcandalous Life, any the meaneſt of his Diſciples, <hi>It were better for him, that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his Neck, and he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea. Woe unto the world, becauſe of Offences;</hi> he adds, <hi>It muſt needs be that Offences come, but Woe to that Man by whom the Offence cometh.</hi> So much it concerns Perſons Eminent in any Kind, that they be Good, as well as Great.</p>

            <p>In the former Attempts upon all Mankind, upon the Church of God, and upon thoſe conſiderable and leading Perſons therein, whoſe Fall ſweeps Multitudes along with 'em into Sin and Ruine; Satan ſhew'd more of his Ambition and Pride, as in ſetting up for a Dominion in direct Oppoſition to God's: So in waging a War with the greateſt Bodies of Men, and the moſt conſiderable Leaders in the <hi>Church Militant.</hi> But in theſe his latter Attempts upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, whereby that Spirit appears not content to Foil greater Numbers, but moreover purſues his Victory to the picking up here and there every particular Stragler; he expreſſes more of his Inveterate Malice, in that he is ſo wholly bent upon Miſchief and Deſtruction, as to ſtick at no Pains, and to leave no Methods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try'd, whereby he may deſtroy every particular Soul amongſt the the Sons of Men.</p>

He now aſſures himſelf, it was by the motion of God's Holy Spirit he is become a new Man, as he thinks, and that he is now infallibly ſafe. Thus have I often known thoſe of the Sect of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have formerly been looſe and riotous Livers, Triumph very much in their preſent State, as certainly from God; becauſe they no ſooner became of this way, but they ceas'd to be Drunkards, and Swearers, and lewd Companions, and the like: Whereas, alas! The deluded Wretch has but Exchang'd ſome groſs Sins of a more <hi>ſcandalous Name,</hi> for other Impieties of a <hi>higher Nature.</hi> For now inſtead of the former more Carnal Sins, he has receiv'd into his Heart the more Spiritual and Deviliſh Ones of Pride, and Haughtineſs, and Contempt of others; being ſo far from <hi>in Honour preferring other Men,</hi> that he will not give the leaſt <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi> He now decries the Inſpir'd Writings of God, as a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40806:71"/> 
               <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and Blaſphemouſly entitles every fooliſh and deceitful Imagination of his own corrupt Heart, to the motion of the Holy Spirit; preferring the latter infinitely before the former. Nay, he now denies all the great Principles of Chriſtianity; the Divinity, Sufferings, and Satisfaction of Chriſt, with the Reſurrection of the Body, as moſt of our preſent Quakers do, and ſo is turn'd meer Deiſt at the beſt. And now who that conſiders this, can think otherwiſe, but that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit went out of that Man, only to return into the Houſe from whence he went out, and to take with himſelf ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, that they entering in, and dwelling there, the laſt State of that Man might be worſe than the firſt?</hi> Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. This is certain,<note place="margin">Such the moſt Irreclaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> the moſt Irreclaimable of all Sinners are thoſe, who have exchang'd ſome ill Practices, for others equally Wicked, and for impious Principles; for ſuch do fix themſelves in a full Perſwaſion, that their preſent Way is of God, ſeeing it is contrary to the former, which was undoubtedly the Way of Satan: Whereas in Truth, both their former ill Practices, and their preſent evil Temper and Principles, are the Children of the ſame Father, tho' unlike to one another in outward Features. So fatal a Deluſion it is of the Devil's, to allow Sinners in performing a kind of <hi>Partial Obedience</hi> to God; nay to further 'em perhaps in the throwing off ſome ſenſual and groſly ſcandalous Courſes, that he may more ſecurely detain 'em Servants and Slaves to himſelf, in the leſs diſcernible ſins of ſpiritual Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another uſual Policy of the Devil's,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> By putting plauſible Names upon the worſt of Sins, under that diſguiſe he does cheat Perſons into a good Opinion of 'em, and then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit 'em.</note> in corrupting of our Manners, is to <hi>Put plauſible Names upon the worſt Sins, and under that diſguiſe to cheat Perſons into a good Opinion of 'em, and then to commit 'em.</hi> And he had the Impudence to Tempt even our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf in this manner. He would have had him to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf headlong from the Pinnacle of the Temple, alledging that <hi>God would give his Angels charge concerning him, and in their hands they ſhould bear him up,</hi> Matth. 4.6. And this no doubt he would have him believe, was a <hi>Truſting in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in like manner, by a Satanical Device the Preſumption of ſome, that they are the Elect, is call'd their Faith, by which they ſhall be Juſtified: Rioting and Drunkenneſs is call'd good Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to be eaſily withdrawn into it, the Effects of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Covetouſneſs, Griping and Extortion, is term'd a providing for One's own, which he that does not do, is worſe than an Infidel. And on the contrary, to be Prodigal and Profuſe, is to be Hoſpitable and Charitable. Spite, Malice, and Revenge is call'd a Hating of of other Men's Sins: And the moſt bitter and fierce Contentions, nay the moſt cruel and bloody Perſecutions, a Zeal for God, and true Religion; and when that Temper is juſtly expos'd to Hatred and Abhorrence, then a Lukewarmneſs, and a meer Indifferency in matters of Religion, whether Truth, or Hereſy prevails; <hi>Gallio's caring for none of thoſe things,</hi> is ſtyl'd the calm and ſweet Temper and Spirit of the Goſpel. Thus does Sin paſs in the World currantly under the mask of Vertue.<note place="margin">Sin in that diſguiſe gets Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men.</note> Vice appearing in its own Colours is ſo odious a thing, that no One but muſt be aſhamed to own it: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adorn'd by the Cunning of Satan with Titles of Reſpect, and in the ſhews of Vertue, it is lookt upon with no evil Eye, but gets Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation

This we gather to be the Devil's Policy from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. where the Apoſtle adviſes the <hi>Corinthians to Forgive</hi> at the laſt, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Perſon amongſt 'em, whom they had deſervedly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and to receive him to the Communion of the Church, being he had Humbled himſelf, and Repented; and that Mercy he would have 'em ſhew him, leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage over 'em: <hi>For we are not ignorant of his Devices,</hi> ſays he, that is, leſt the too long continuance of the Puniſhments they inflicted upon the Penitent Offender, might be made uſe of by Satan to the hurt and ruine of the Church, by hightning their Zeal againſt Sin into an Irreconcilableneſs to the Sinner. And indeed there are many Sins and Vertues ſo near in their Nature, that the Paſſage from one to the other is hardly diſcernible; inſomuch, that by the Art of Satan we eaſily ſlide from one to the other: As Obſtinacy in ſtanding out againſt all Conviction concerning the Truth, is eaſily miſtaken for Conſtancy in the Faith, and the Love of our ſelves, for the Love of God. But eſpecially, that Zeal for God's Glory, now mention'd, a moſt Excellent Grace in it ſelf, is often, and that eaſily Tranſported into Cruelty, as we ſee it was in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who out of a Zeal for the Law, <hi>Beyond meaſure perſecuted the Church of God, and waſted it,</hi> Gal. 1.13. Thus by changing the Nature of ſeveral Divine Graces and Vertues, ſo that they become very great ſins, does Satan eaſily betray us into them.</p>

            <p>Which Inability, or Weakneſs, I ſay, to go through any <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and <hi>undertaken</hi> Piece of Diſcipline, as of long Faſtings, and Watchings at ſuch ſet Hours of the Night, or the Performance of certain Vows, which ſome do lay upon themſelves; theſe, tho' they may be ſerviceable to promote a ſpiritual Life, if diſcreetly and adviſedly undertaken by a Perſon, and with a juſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had to his own Ability and Circumſtances: yet they are greater Severities than what many can go through with, and when impos'd upon themſelves by ſuch, they give occaſion to Satan to Tempt 'em to throw off thoſe voluntary Services, together with all Religion, as not Performable by Fleſh and Blood, or by any thing ſhort of Angels. Whereas indeed, it is not the Subſtantials of Religion, ſuch as our Saviour preſcrib'd, whoſe <hi>Yoke is eaſy, and whoſe Burden is light,</hi> Matth. 11.30. that are ſo; but thoſe Acceſſories and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages to it, which ſome do indiſcreetly, and without regard to their own Capacities and Circumſtances, lay upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>And here it may be uſeful to let you know, what a Great Maſter in the ſpiritual Life obſerves,<note place="margin">Bona de Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God's Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Devil's Management of Men in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> concerning the difference between God's Ordering, and the Devil's Management of Men in theſe matters. <q>God begins with us at low Degrees, and gently leads us from an imperfect, to a perfect State. He has regard to Perſons and their Age, and imparts one degree of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Aged, another to Youth, one to Beginners, another to the Perfect. But the Devil on the contrary, obſerves no Order, but darts into our Souls unſeaſonable Heats, and forthwith ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts Exceſſes in Devotion. He perſwades ſuch immediately to undertake immoderate Faſtings and Watchings, and to mortify the Body by intolerable Penances.</q> And theſe Burdens, becauſe they lay upon themſelves without meaſure, they are not able to bear; and then their Strength being broke, and the Vigour of their Minds abated, they do at length backſlide into meer Indifferency and Looſeneſs. And yet to ſee the crooked Windings of this <hi>wily Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> as much as he is for ſcrewing Perſons up to Exceſſes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Satan by Injecting of evil Thoughts into our Minds, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and diſturb our Devotions, is very Induſtrious to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhallow and Spoil thoſe Services, whereby we ſhall moſt really, and immediately, and directly Honour and Glorify our Maker, and Benefit our own Souls.</hi>

Thus we read, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. that <hi>when the Sons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, Satan came alſo amongſt them.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3.1. we find, that <hi>when</hi> Joſhua <hi>the High-Prieſt ſtood before the Angel of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40806:73"/> Lord, Satan ſtood at his Right-hand to Reſiſt him.</hi> And the Beſt of Chriſtians alſo, who upon other Objects of far leſs Concern, and at other times, can fix their Minds ſteddily, do often complain, that ſometimes in their Prayers they are ſtrangely broken, and the Intention of their Minds frequently taken off by odd Thoughts, roving Fancies, and far fetcht Imaginations. This ſure cannot happen, but by the importunate Urgency of ſome malicious Spirit, who is marvellouſly Induſtrious to let and hinder us in nothing more, than in this moſt Glorious and Beneficial Service, of our Prayers and Praiſes to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And thus he hinders the Efficacy of the Word.</note>And hence alſo in the <hi>Hearing of the Word,</hi> does he either bring a Drowſineſs upon the Hearers, ſo that even at the very inſtant, we the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt are Proclaiming to ſinful Men, thoſe gracious Terms of Reconciliation ſent to them by us, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty of Heaven: They will even ſleep all the time of its Delivery, or he will endeavour to poſſeſs their Minds with ſuch vain, wandring and worldly Thoughts, that the Seed ſown, for want of their Attention, can never take Root in their Hearts. And this not attending to, and not conſidering what you are about, and what you hear, is expreſly affirm'd to be from Satan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. <hi>When any One heareth the Word, and underſtandeth it not,</hi> that is, lays it not to Heart, thinks not of it, nor conſiders it; for ſo the Word Tranſlate <hi>

            </p>

And if a Man be Sick, and want preſent Help in lawful Means, then will the Devil Tempt ſuch a One, to ſeek his Remedy by Charms and Spells, as a more ſhort, certain, and eaſy way of Curing, than by Phyſical Medicines; and no doubt the Devil may ſometimes work extraordinary Feats by theſe Methods, the better to keep Mankind in Dependance upon himſelf: But it is a certain ſign of want of Grace, and of none, no not the leaſt Fear of God in them, who ſhall reſort in ſuch Caſes to Perſons ſuſpected to hold Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Devil, and ſhall make uſe of thoſe means of Cure preſcrib'd by 'em, concerning whoſe Operation of any ſuch Cure, no Reaſon in Nature can be given, nor the Appointment of God pretended, that ſuch Words, tho' they may be Words of Scripture, ſhould work ſuch Effects.</p>

And hence it is, that ſo many miſerable Wretches hang, ſtab, drown, or ſhoot themſelves, being thus Tempted thereto by Satan. And hence it is, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a melancholly Temper of Mind are ſo apt, above others, to be troubled with Blaſphemous Thoughts, tho' Perſons of great Piety, and ſuch as have all along <hi>Feared God, and kept his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Both theſe, and the former Apprehenſions are ſome of thoſe <hi>Fiery Darts of the Devil,</hi> mention'd <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. caſt into the Soul at ſuch time, when they are leaſt able to Repel 'em; and that on purpoſe to diſturb the poor melancholly Wretch to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo as to do Violence to his own Nature, and to Deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or to force from him Expreſſions moſt highly Diſhonourable to God, and Terrible to Chriſtian Ears to hear. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, The great Battery of the Devil,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> Above all by Repreſenting to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Men, the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the Sweetneſs of Pleaſures, he does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Bribe 'em to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and to Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Souls.</note> whereby he does ſtorm the Innocency, and ſhake the Conſtancy of the greateſt part of Mankind, <hi>Is his Repreſenting to the Fancy of Men, the Conveniency of Riches, the Glory of Honours, and the Sweetneſs of Pleaſures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Bribe 'em to Rebel againſt God, and to Sin againſt their own Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I call his great Battery, and uſually therefore he does Aſſault us therewith, not till all others have fail'd him. In this manner he dealt with our Saviour. When all his other Temptations prov'd ineffectual, <hi>The Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of 'em. And ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if Thou wilt fall down and Worſhip me,</hi> Matth. 4.8, 9. But altho' the Son of God was no more to be won upon by this, than by any of the former, to comply in the leaſt with the Deſigns of the wicked Tempter: Yet the Weakneſs of the Generality of Men is ſuch, that they are Brib'd hereby, when nothing elſe can prevail, to Apoſtatize from God, to do Injuries to Men, and to do the greateſt Abuſes to their own Reaſon and Nature; and in ſhort to commit every Kind of Sin, whereby God is Diſhonour'd, and they themſelves ſhall be finally Ruin'd.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Manner</hi> and Cunning wherewith the Devil manages theſe Temptations, is extreamly well worth your Notice.<note place="margin">In his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this World's Goods, he ſhews only the fair out-ſide to allure into Sin, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is hurtful therein, and would deter Men from it.</note> When he makes any Repreſentation to our Souls of this World's Glory, he only ſhews us the faireſt Out-ſide of thoſe Things, to allure us thereby into Sin, induſtriouſly concealing all that is vain, and vexatious, and ſtinging therein, which would deter us from it. Thus he manag'd the matter with our Saviour, and thus he does ſtill with us. In that World, and the Glory thereof, which he ſhew'd to our Bleſſed Lord, there was a great mixture of Confuſion, and Diſorder, and Croſſes, and Vexations, and Troubles; but nothing of this did he repreſent to his View, when he offer'd it to him as a Bribe; but only gave him to ſee the Plenty, the Grandeur, the Beauty thereof, ſeparated from the other ungrateful and diſpleaſing Part: And ſo he deals with us. He does very lively preſent to Men the Advantage of Riches, how that Money commands all Things, and then ſtirs up their Covetous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40806:74"/> after it, ſo as to get it they care not how, by Thieving, and Robbery, by Cozennage, and Extortion, and Sacriledge, or by any unlawful Arts and Methods. He does dazle their Eyes with the Splendor and Glory of High Places, lets 'em ſee the Cap, and the Knee, and low Obeiſances, and the ſervile Flatteries made to the Grandees of this World, to ſtir up their Ambition to wade through Seas of Blood, and to tread upon the Necks of oppreſſed Provinces, in order to mount thoſe Seats of Honour. And laſtly, he does very lively lay before their Eyes the Luxury and Wantonneſs, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eaſe found in ſenſual Pleaſures, and ſo inflames their Luſts and Appetites after the Enjoyment of 'em. But he draws a dark ſhade over the deformed Part of the World, that we may not perceive thoſe manifold Troubles, and Vexations, and Diſappointments, and Puniſhments, attending theſe Things in the unlawful getting of 'em, and the never-failing Remorſes and Regrets of Conſcience, Amazing, and Diſtracting, and ſtinging with a Venom more inflam'd and furious than that of Scorpions, the Souls who wickedly purſue and attain to thoſe Things. All this dark Part he reſerves till this World's Goods are ſo unjuſtly got, to work upon their Shame and Deſpair, in order to promote his farther Deſigns upon 'em, as you will ſee in his following Temptations.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> then muſt the Injur'd Husband be made Drunk, that his Lying with his Wife might not be Diſcover'd, when he return'd from the Battle; but that He and the World might think the Child Begotten was his own: And when that would not make <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> go in unto his Wife, then at laſt he muſt be Murder'd, by being put into the Front of the Battle, and then Treacherouſly left to be Cut off by the Enemy, that ſhe being freed of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Husband, he might without Scandal to the Eye of the world, Enjoy her as his own Wife. And how often do we ſee the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to draw Men into Sin, Acted over and over at this Day, and many lewd, ungodly Perſons, after they have committed Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, privately to Murder their own Off-ſpring, to prevent the Shame and Diſgrace that will follow the Fact being known. And when Children and Servants have done amiſs, how commonly are they prompted to tell a Lye, nay, and ſometimes to Swear to it, that it may not be Diſcover'd? The Devil well knows that Sin is like laying a Train of Gun-powder, which if you Fire but One Corn, it will preſently give Flame to all the Reſt: So one Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the ſhame of that will engage you to commit another to hide the former. And therefore it is, I ſay, the uſual Policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, when he has Tempted any Perſon to commit a Wickedneſs, then to lay the Shame and Diſgrace thereof ſo ſenſibly before him, that he ſhall again commit a worſe, on purpoſe to cover the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the former from the Eyes of Men.</p>

            <p>'Tis indeed a thing almoſt incredible, that a <hi>Creature</hi> could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be guilty of ſuch impudent Pride and Ambition, as to juſtle God, as it were, out of his Throne, and to Arrogate to himſelf the Homage of all the Creatures; but yet it appears to be plainly ſo, by his Tempting even of the Son of God himſelf to Worſhip and Adore him, and in his Plying him ſo diligently with one Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after another, never letting him reſt, till he ſaw there was no Hopes. He perceiv'd, that his Coming into the World was to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Kingdom, and therefore he firſt Attacks him in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, thinking he had him at an Advantage, after a long Faſt of Forty Days, and that in his Hunger he would do any thing to get Bread. And when our Saviour alledg'd his ſufficiency in God alone, without material Bread, he then takes him up into the Holy City, and ſetteth him on the Pinacle of the Temple; bidding him, if he were ſo confident of God's Protection and Preſervation of him, to caſt himſelf down from thence, and no doubt he would order his Holy Angels to receive him. And when in that alſo he was Repuls'd, Satan try'd him farther yet, and taking him into an exceeding high Mountain, where he gave him a <hi>Viſionary View</hi> of all the Riches, Glory and Splendor of the World, and proffer'd him, that if he would Fall down and Worſhip him; that is, Deſert the Service of the God of Heaven, and coming over to him, would Propagate and Promote his Kingdom, and do Homage himſelf, and cauſe all others to do the like to him: This, if he would do, Satan Promis'd him all theſe Things would he give him. Thus like a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Prince, who would Bribe with Riches, and Honours, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the General of another's Army, to come over to him, and to Betray into his Power all his own King's Subjects: So did the Devil Tempt our Saviour <hi>the Great Captain of our Salvation,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt himſelf from God, and to bring over the whole Church along with him. So infinitely Bent is Satan upon the Diſhonour of God, and our Slavery and Ruine; which as it is enough to rouze us up to make a moſt diligent Enquiry, till we fully diſcover all the Arts and Methods, whereby he would Accompliſh it: So it will, I hope, ſufficiently Juſtify my having been ſo long in laying before you, <hi>Who the Devil is, and what are his Works,</hi> both of Sin and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

               <hi>walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour, whom Reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> And indeed Sobriety, as it is contrary both to Drunkenneſs, and Paſſion, is a great and moſt neceſſary Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt Satan's Temptations. <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is a thing does ſo Overwhelm all the Powers of the Soul, that whilſt a Perſon is in that Condition, he has little, ſometimes no uſe of his Memory, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Judgment, ſo as to have any Thoughts of Good and Evil, or to diſcern between what is Fit and Reaſonable, and what is Hurtful and Brutiſh. And only the Luſts and Appetites of a Man are then awake, ready to hurry him to whatſoever Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40806:76"/> he ſhall be Tempted. And do you think, that the Devil, who is ſo Cunning in Timing his Temptations, will then be Idle, and not ſtrike in with the Seaſon, and at ſuch an Opportunity preſent to the Wretch, when depriv'd of Reaſon and Grace, ſuch Baits as ſhall be likelieſt to take him? Why, this to be ſure he will; and hence we hear of ſo many brutiſh Extravagancies, and ſinful Frolicks, ſo much Lewdneſs, Swearing, Robberies and Blood-ſhed, acted and committed in Drunkenneſs: Such great Reaſon there is, that as you would preſerve your ſelves from Sin; ſo likewiſe muſt you preſerve your ſelves Sober and Free from Drunkenneſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will be Overtaken therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And likewiſe Sober and Free from Paſſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> As oppoſite to Paſſion.</note> in which caſe Perſons are as much depriv'd of Reaſon, as in the other, and are hurry'd on to the like Commiſſions; and the Devil will be alike ready, both to Influence the Paſſion, and to ſuggeſt Provocations, if Sobriety does not ſtrike in, and moderate. Hence is the Paſſionate and Violent Tongue, ſaid to be <hi>Set on Fire of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Watchfulneſs is another Means to Reſiſt Temptations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Watchful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe our weakneſſes, eſpecially where Satan will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt us.</note> Thus again, in order thereunto, in the ſame Place of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Ep. 5.8, 9. it is ſaid, <hi>Be Sober, be Vigilant.</hi> He is Vigilant for his Part to do you Miſchief, and watches all Advantages, to get you into his Power and Reach: And it lies upon you to be as careful to Guard your ſelves againſt all his Batteries, which he Plays againſt you. He ſurrounds the Soul, and views it on all ſides: <q>And this great Enemy of Mankind, ſays a Father, does there lay his Snares of Deceit, where there is the greateſt Probability they will take us. He knows to whom he may beſt apply the Heats of Luſt, before whom he may ſpread the Table of Gluttony, and to whoſe View he may diſplay the Enchantments of all ſorts of Luxury. He conſiders the Temper of Men's Minds, and whom he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order with Grief, and whom he may deceive with Joy, whom he can oppreſs with Fear, and whom he may ſeduce with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and into whoſe Breaſt he can moſt eaſily Infuſe the Poiſon of Envy. He examines the Cuſtoms of Men, he conſiders what are their Cares, and he ſearches which are our prevailing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And by that he takes occaſion to do us the greateſt hurt, to which he ſees we are moſt violently addicted, and about which he ſees us moſt induſtriouſly Employ'd. Like an Enemy, who Beſieges a City, does always aſſault the weakeſt part of the Walls: So does he attack the Soul, where he perceives its greateſt Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</q> Such infinite Reaſon have we to conſider our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to keep a particular watch on that ſide, where we are moſt Blind, and to ſet our ſelves with the greateſt Vigour to Reſiſt and Repel the Temptations, wherewith he will aſſault us there. And this is the Second way given you in Scripture to Reſiſt Satan's Temptations, <hi>viz.</hi> Watchfulneſs and Diligence to know our ſelves, and to diſcern his Temptations, that ſo you may not be Enſnared by them. The</p>
            <p>Third, <hi>Is by Prayer to God to Protect you from them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">And Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt be conſtant and fervent in Prayer to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:40806:77"/> Addreſſes to God by Prayer, he will be ready to aſſiſt us againſt all his Temptations. And indeed there is extraordinary Reaſon, you ſhould diligently and earneſtly Pray to God, to Protect and Preſerve you from Satan's Deluſions. The Devil is a Spirit, and therefore is naturally Endow'd with a great deal of Knowledge, abundance more than we Men are capable of attaining to. And moreover, by the Experience of many Thouſand Years, from the Creation of the World, unto this Day, he has greatly Improv'd himſelf in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſchievous Cunning and Subtlety; ſo as not to be Ignorant of any way, whereby he may moſt ſucceſsfully prevail over us, to draw us into Sin. Both which things conſider'd, we were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Cope with him, if left to our ſelves. But our Comfort is this, that the Devil can go no farther than his Chain; and as the Divine Goodneſs will not Permit him to attempt whom, and how he pleaſes: (It was not before he had Leave, that he could Tempt <hi>Job,</hi> 2.6.) ſo in reference to all ſorts of Temptations whatſoever, we have a moſt ſure word of Promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. that <hi>God is Faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be Tempted above that you are able, but will with the Temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi> But then, if you would have him a Protector always ready at Hand to aſſiſt you, you muſt, as was ſaid, <hi>Draw nigh to him, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi>

            <p>What ſhall I ſay?

               <hi>THE Fourteenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
            <p>HAVING already, in order to the Explication of theſe Words, ſhew'd you, <hi>Who the Devil is, what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how neceſſary it is we ſhould abſolutely do ſo;</hi> I come now,</p>
            <p>Secondly, In like manner to Explain unto you,<note place="margin">What's meant by the Pomps and Vanity of the wicked World, and in what ſence, and how far we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the wicked world w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> its Pomps and Vanity. Three things here to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, and accordingly Renounced: <hi>1.</hi> The world; <hi>2.</hi> The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World; and <hi>3.</hi> The Pomps and Vanity of this wicked world</note> 
               <hi>What is meant by the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and to ſhew you in what Sence, and how far you muſt Renounce the wicked World, with its Pomps and Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Renounce the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World.</hi> There is not a word here but will require ſome Explication. As to the word <hi>Renounce</hi> indeed it may ſuffice, what I before told you, that it is of various Significations, according to the Nature of the Thing to be Renounc'd by us: And there being Three Things in theſe Words neceſſary to be Explain'd,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The World;</hi> Secondly, <hi>the wicked World;</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World;</hi> I will Expound to you the Meaning of each, and will withal ſhew you in what ſence, and how far you are to Renounce every One of them.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, <hi>I am to ſhew you, what is meant by the World, and in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce the World.</hi> The World in Scripture does generally paſs under a very bad Character, and for the moſt part is mention'd, as what does directly oppoſe God's Glory, and our own Happineſs. Thus Jam. 4.4. <hi>Know ye not that the Friendſhip of the World is Enmity with God, and whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a Friend of the World, is an Enemy of God.</hi> And on the contrary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Character of himſelf,<note place="margin">The World a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God's Glory, and our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</note> 
               <hi>That through the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the World is Crucified unto him, and he unto the World.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. it is univerſally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, overcometh the World:</hi> And therefore in the Second Chapter of the ſame <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 15, 16. we are commanded, <hi>Not to love the World, neither the Things that are in the World,</hi> being aſſur'd, that <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And indeed, if we ſhall ſearch through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book of God, we ſhall find ſuch frequent and earneſt Commands to Renounce this World, and to beware of its Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40806:78"/> that nothing, except Satan the Ring-leader of all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, ſeems to be a more Mortal Enemy to the Happineſs and Salvation of Mankind, than this <hi>World.</hi> And all this conſider'd, as alſo, that it is made ſo material a Part of our Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Renounce,</hi> as the Devil, ſo the <hi>World;</hi> I think it concerns you to be well informed, what is meant both in Scripture, and your Catechiſm, by that <hi>World,</hi> which you are ſo oblig'd to Renounce, and in what ſence, and how far you are to Renounce it.</p>
            <p>And a more nice and critical Enquiry and State of this Matter is the rather neceſſary, becauſe the World, as hardly as it is ſpoke of, is not abſolutely, and in its own Nature Evil, as the Devil is; for conſider'd in it ſelf, it is the Creature of God, and conſequently very Good, according to that Divine Teſtimony given thereunto, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very Good:</hi> And it is only Evil accidentally by our Abuſe of it. That therefore you may Err on neither ſide, neither deſpiſe the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God's Hands, to the Diſparagement of God's Goodneſs, in giving us of his Creatures for our Uſe and Convenience; nor too much Dote upon the <hi>Creature,</hi> to the Neglect of the <hi>Creator,</hi> which is a Degree of Idolatry:<note place="margin">It is to be conſider'd both generally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> I will, with what Skill God ſhall enable me, ſtate this whole matter to you, and ſhew you, <hi>What is meant by the World, and in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce it.</hi> And for the more full and compleat Explication of this Point, I will do it, both Generally and Particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> By the world in general is meant that whole Frame of Nature, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and all that variety of Creatures, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and is given us by the Bounty and Goodneſs of God, for our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Benefit.</note>And Firſt as to the World in General, it is viſible what is meant by it, <hi>viz.</hi> The whole Frame of Nature, which we behold, with whatever is contain'd therein. True it is, the World is put many times in Scripture, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.7. and often elſewhere, to ſignify Evil Men, becauſe that the Wicked make up the greateſt Part of Men in this world. But this is an improper and figurative meaning of the world, Evil Men being but a part of the world, and in this Sence will better be conſider'd by us under the next general Point to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>wicked World.</hi> But <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8. and in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Places of the Scriptures, by the World is meant, that whole Frame of Nature, which we behold, and all that Variety of Creatures, which it contains, and is given us by the Bounty and Goodneſs of God, for our Uſe and Benefit.</p>
            <p>And now the great Queſtion will be, <hi>In what Sence, and how far we muſt Renounce the World, in this Sence of the Word.</hi> And there are not ordinary Miſtakes about it; For ſome ſhall Cry out moſt grievouſly againſt this World, as the Author of all their Sin and Miſery; and therefore many have endeavour'd to fly out of it, as it were, into Deſarts, living ſeparate from Mankind, and without the Conveniencies of Life, as the Hermits of Old; and into Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Monaſteries, as the ſeveral Orders of Monks and Friars at this Day in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The world in this Sence is not in it ſelf Evil, but only accidentally, by Man's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or it.</note> But certainly the World does not deſerve to be ſo ſpitefully us'd, as the Words and Actions of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and miſtaken Men do import. For to uſe the words of a great Man, <q>The World is certainly in it ſelf Good, and is not Evil, but accidentally by Man's Abuſe of himſelf, or it. It doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a general ſupply of Objects anſwerable to the Deſires of our ſenſible Nature, and the Exigencies and Conveniencies of it: It is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40806:78"/> a great Shop, full of all ſorts of Wares, anſwerable to our Wants, or Conditions. There is Wealth, and Places, and Delights for the Senſes; and it becomes an Enemy to us, by reaſon only of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Irregularity of thoſe Luſts and Paſſions, that are within us, and by reaſon of the Over-value, that we are apt to put upon them. They are indeed Temptations, but they are only Paſſive, as the wedge of Gold did Paſſively Tempt <hi>Achan,</hi> but it was his own Luſt and Covetouſneſs, that did him the Harm. The Rock doth not ſtrike the Ship, but the Ship ſtrikes the Rock, and breaks it ſelf.</q>

               <q>Nay, this World, as it is not Evil in it ſelf,<note place="margin">Conſidered in it ſelf it is very Good, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to us.</note> ſo moſt certainly it is full of Goodneſs and Benevolence to us: It ſupplies our Wants; it is accommodate to the Exigencies and Conveniencies of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it furniſhes us with various Objects, and Inſtances of the Divine Goodneſs, Liberality, Bounty; of his Power, and Majeſty, and Glory; of his Wiſdom, Providence, and Government: which are ſo many Inſtructions to teach us to Know, and Admire,<note place="margin">And as it is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf Evil, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to be Renounced; but being Good in it ſelf it may inſome meaſure be deſired and enjoy'd by us.</note> and Magnify him; to walk Thankfully, Dutifully, and Obediently unto him; to teach us Reſignation, Contentedneſs, Submiſſion, and Dependance upon him. A good Heart will be made the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it; and if there be Evil in it, it is ſuch as our own corrupt Natures occaſions, or brings upon it, or upon our ſelves by it; and it is a great Part of our Chriſtian Warfare and Diſcipline to teach us to uſe it, as it ought to be uſed, and to ſubdue thoſe Luſts and Corruptions that abuſe it, and our ſelves by it.</q> So that the World you ſee is not abſolutely, and in it ſelf Evil, nor is it conſequently entirely to be Renounced by us: But it is in it ſelf Good, and as ſuch it may in due meaſure be deſir'd and enjoy'd by us.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs through our own Corruption,<note place="margin">Nevertheleſs through our own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we abuſe the good Things of the world, it becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally the occaſion of moſt of our Sins, and of our Eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Good</note> whereby we abuſe theſe good Things of the World, which the Divine Bounty has beſtowed upon us for our Support, Comfort, and Convenience, the World becomes <hi>Accidentally the occaſion of moſt of our Sins, and of our Eſtrangement from God, our ſoveraign Good.</hi> And how the World does accidentally become the occaſion of much Sin committed by us, and as ſuch, how far it ought to be Renounced, I take to be a Point that is very requiſite you ſhould be well inſtructed in.</p>
            <p>And the Caſe you muſt know betwixt Us and the World ſtands thus: Man is a Compound Being, made up of Two different and diſtinct Natures, a Body, and a Soul; the one purely Material and Earthly, the other Spiritual and Heavenly; the one Inferior, the other Superior in Worth and Dignity; the one Mortal and Periſhing, the other Immortal and Everlaſting. Hence Man is by ſome called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Akin to Two Worlds, the Knot, as it were, that ties 'em both together, or the Button that faſtens 'em one to another.<note place="margin">How the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo.</note> Now Man conſiſting of theſe Two Principles, according to One whereof, and that the Principal, he is nearly ally'd to God, (for according to his Soul, he is the very Image of God) it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably requir'd of him, That he ſhould chiefly mind Heaven, and Heavenly Things, his near and chief Relations, (if I may ſo ſay) which he is Everlaſtingly to enjoy; and that he ſhould not much concern himſelf with the Things of this world, which he muſt ſhortly leave behind him, and then all Relation betwixt 'em will
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40806:79"/> ceaſe. But all the time of his Pilgrimage here, Living and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing for the moſt part with the Things below, he becomes ſooner acquainted with them, and they with him, they have an eaſier Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him than Heavenly Things, and have therefore greater Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to court his Affections, and to win upon 'em: So that in the End it too often falls out that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule is liv'd Counter to, and Men generally <hi>Set their Affections on things below, and not on things above.</hi>

The Affections becoming hereby moſt eagerly deſirous of 'em, do put a falſe Biaſs upon the Judgment, ſo that our Underſtanding and Reaſon uſually becomes thereby ſo far Corrupted, as to dictate to the Will, that theſe outward and ſenſible good Things, are the Objects, which are above all others worthy of its Choice. And thereupon the Will does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately chooſe the preſent Objects of Senſe, the Riches, Honours and Pleaſures of this World, prefering 'em far before ſpiritual Things.

                  <hi>II.</hi> And no leſs Temptations are thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, who do poſſeſs 'em.</note> Experience tells us, that a great Eſtate, is a very great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Idleneſs and Luxury, to Pride and Inſolence, to Irreligion towards God, and a Profane, Idolatrous Truſt in Riches: And in a word, to Commit the higheſt Offences towards God, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Themſelves. I ſay, to <hi>Idleneſs and Luxury,</hi> the former whereof is the Ruſt of the Mind, the latter is a Canker, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and deſtroys the Body. And how great a Temptation to Idleneſs and Luxury Riches are, is eminently ſeen in the Caſe of the Rich Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. He had no ſooner got his Barns and his Coffers full, but he Sings a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul, <hi>Soul thou haſt much Good laid up for many Years, take thine Eaſe, Eat, Drink, and be Merry.</hi> And ſo likewiſe, they are a ſtrong Temptation to <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Inſolence,</hi> and that in Reſpect both to God, and Man. As to his Behaviour towards God, how apt is the Rich Man, in the midſt of all his Succeſſes, <hi>to Sacrifice to his own Net, and to Burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to his own Drag,</hi> as the Prophet words it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16. that is, to Attribute all to his own Wit and Policy, and Conduct, excluſive of God's Providence? And then, as to his Carriage towards Men, how often do Riches make thoſe, that have 'em, to carry themſelves with a moſt unreaſonable Haughtineſs and Diſreſpect towards Perſons of lower Fortunes, to look upon Men of little, or no Eſtates, as the Cattle only, and Vermin of the World, and to treat 'em as their Slaves and Vaſſals, as if they were not Creatures of the ſame Kind with themſelves, and had not Souls, as Precious in God's ſight, as their own? And then, as to Irreligion, and Inſolence towards God: The impious Contempt of God, and of all that is Sacred, which Men in the midſt of their Abundance do caſt upon that Bountiful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, who <hi>Gave 'em all things Richly to Enjoy,</hi> cannot be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcrib'd than in the Caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 32.13, 14, 15. <hi>He made him ride on the high Places of the Earth, that he might eat the Increaſe of the Field; but</hi> Jeſhurun <hi>waxed fat and kicked; thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs, then he forſook God, which made him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of his Salvation.</hi> But as to that Profane and Idolatrous Truſt in Riches, which is ſo Deteſtable before God, this is ſo much the natural Effect of Wealth, that very good Men will be apt to ſlide into that very ſinful Temper of Mind, if they do not take care. <hi>In my Proſperity I ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Men are Tempted to the highest Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Themſelves.</note>

Our Bleſſed Saviour tells us, that <hi>Whoſoever he be, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not whatever he hath for his ſake, and the Goſpels, he cannot be his Diſciple; and to leave Houſes, Lands, Poſſeſſions,</hi> and whatever worldly Enjoyments, if you will not Renounce the Goſpel it ſelf, or thoſe Truths contain'd therein, and will not embrace Errors contrary to it, is always the hard Condition that Chriſtians are put upon in Times of Perſecution. But how hard a Thing is it for a Rich Man to do this? A poor Wretch may be content to leave his uncomfortable Manſion, and to Reſign this laborious tedious Life, in hopes of gaining Reſt, and eternal Glory thereby, rather than ſtrain his Conſcience: But for a Rich Man to take a Farewel of his ſtately Houſes, delightful Gardens, his ſilent Grots, and ſhady Walks, his rich Furniture, goodly Farms, and his heaps of Silver; to leave theſe, and fly into Baniſhment, endure Poverty, labour with Hunger, and ſtarve with Nakedneſs; all this to preſerve a good Conſcience: It is a <hi>hard Saying,</hi> a ſhrewd Temptation! He will be apt to deſire his Settlement, may be, <hi>on this ſide Jordan,</hi> rather than he will paſs over the Flood, into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> He will be very apt to <hi>build his Tabernacle</hi> on this ſide Heaven. The Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is indeed Great, and many have fallen under the Power of it. Several have paſt very ſhrewd Bruſhes in their way towards Heaven, and yet have not been able to withſtand the Shock of this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We have a famous Inſtance of this in the Young Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. This Perſon came to our Saviour, with a mighty Deſire to know, what he ſhould do to <hi>Inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and reckon'd up a many extraordinary Acts, that he had done already in order to it, (inſomuch that in another Goſpel it is recorded, our Saviour <hi>Loved him very much</hi>) But the Holy Jeſus told him, that if he would <hi>Be perfect, he muſt go and ſell what he had, and give to the Poor, and he ſhould have Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> and that he muſt in Poverty and Affliction come and follow him; <hi>When the young Man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful, for he had great Poſſeſſions,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. And thus you ſee what Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations Riches will give you, whether you conſider your ſelves as <hi>Getting,</hi> as <hi>Poſſeſſing;</hi> or as <hi>Parting with,</hi> or <hi>Loſing of them.</hi>

And you muſt take care, leſt you alſo Incurr that, and a worſe Rebuke, by ſpending the Lord's Day, ſet apart by Divine Appointment, wholly to the Service of God; leſt you ſpend it, I ſay, in worldly Buſineſs, and in Projects of Gain: Or indeed any Day in immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Carkings, ſo as to omit either your Family, or Private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And as Idleneſs, ſo is Luxury a Crying Sin, as will appear by conſidering the fearful Doom pronounc'd by St. <hi>James</hi> to ſuch Rich Ones, as wanton it in nothing but Pleaſure. <hi>Go to now ye Rich men, weep and howl for your Miſeries that ſhall come upon you, ye have lived in pleaſure on the Earth, and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your Hearts as in a day of Slaughter,</hi> Jam. 5.1.5.</p>
            <p>And as to Pride, For any Perſon, be he never ſo Wealthy, to be pufft up by his Eſtate, to carry it <hi>Proudly and Inſolently</hi> towards other Men of lower Fortunes; (the uſual Effect of Riches) this alſo is a thing ſeverely Threaten'd in the now cited place of St. <hi>James,</hi> viz. Chap. 5. ver. 1.5, 6.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:40806:82"/>
            <p>But as to that Exalting themſelves againſt God, in an utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of his Laws, which ſo many Rich and Great Men are ſubject to, <hi>Who, when God has fed them to the full, do then commit Adultery, and aſſemble themſelves by Troops in the Harlots houſes, and are as fed Horſes in the Morning, every One Neighing after his Neighbour's Wife; ſhall I not Viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord, ſhall not my Soul be Avenged on ſuch a People as this?</hi> Says God by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. Sure ſuch an inſolent Contempt of God's Laws, and haughty Pride againſt him, will moſt terribly provoke his Indignation at the laſt. And ſo,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, will a Profane and Idolatrous Truſt in Riches, to which the wealthy Ones are ſo extreamly liable. <hi>God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.5. <hi>He ſhall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy Dwelling-place, and root thee out of the Land of the Living.</hi> And who is this that he will ſerve ſo? <hi>Lo the Man that made not God his Strength, but Truſted in the Abundance of his Riches, and ſtrengthen'd himſelf in his Subſtance,</hi> ver. 7. The Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men do ſo much Covet after, and ſo cloſely Hug their Riches, is becauſe they take 'em to be a ſure Security againſt all Misfortunes and Troubles, and will be a Refuge to 'em, they think, in the Days of Calamity. But alas! There is nothing more Uncertain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more Dangerous to the Owners thereof, than Riches. They can neither Fence off Death, nor Sufferings, but do moſt uſually bring on both, and that both from the Reaſon of the thing, as they Excite the Envy, and are a Bait to the Covetouſneſs of others to Diſpoſſeſs him, who Enjoys 'em; and by the juſt Judgment of God, when Men have unlawfully got, or abus'd 'em.</p>
            <p>And now all this conſider'd, ſince Idleneſs and Luxury, Pride and Inſolence, and a Truſt in Riches, are ſo highly Provoking to God; and ſince the Rich are ſo extreamly liable to theſe, of all others: The Poſſeſſors of great Eſtates would do well and wiſely too, ſo far to Renounce 'em, as to Pare off thoſe Superfluities in their Fortunes, and to beſtow all that to Pious and Charitable Uſes, which Tempt 'em to ſuch Pernicious Vices. Nor is this a more hard and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Leſſon, than what was given by our Saviour in a like Caſe. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. ſays he, <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee pluck out, and caſt it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that One of thy Members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell.</hi> And ſo we may ſay in this. If Superfluity and Abundance, and more than is neceſſary, to provide a Perſon of thoſe Conveniencies, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to that State and Condition, wherein Providence has Plac'd him in the World, does directly tend to thoſe Vices now nam'd; then it is much better, that with <hi>Crates</hi> he ſhould even throw away that Superfluity: For much better it is, that his worldly Wealth ſhould ſink into the Bottom of the Sea, than that it ſhould ſink him, both Body and Soul, in Hell. But there is no Neceſſity for any Man to throw that away, which God has beſtow'd upon him for better Uſes. Take care to do Good therewith, and then it will Open unto you the Gates of Heaven. In ſo doing you will Renounce thoſe Superfluities of an Eſtate, as to your own proper Uſe, but however it will return into your own Boſoms at laſt, with infinite Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Intereſt.

God, true it is, does not always make it the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Diſciple to <hi>Sell all that he hath, and to give it to the Poor,</hi> as he Commanded him in the Goſpel, upon an extraordinary Occaſion. Nor does he always put us upon the fiery Tryal, either to leave all, or preſerve a good Conſcience. But however, there is doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a better Uſe to be made of Riches, and larger Diſtributions of what God hath Bleſt them withal, to Pious and Charitable Uſes, than moſt of our Rich Ones do commonly think. And it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, that tho' we are not always put to the actual Tryal, whether we will follow Chriſt in the Adherence to Truth, and by Renouncing of Error, or retain our Riches: Yet it is ever requir'd, that we ſhould be readily diſpos'd to <hi>Forſake all, and follow Chriſt,</hi> ſuppoſe there were Occaſion, which muſt be the Import of theſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi> Every One is not actually call'd to take up the Croſs, by abandoning his worldly Poſſeſſions, or in any other way; the Meaning muſt be, that every Diſciple muſt let this World's Goods hang very looſe about him, ſo that he could eaſily put 'em off, when call'd to it. And God, who ſearches the Heart, and tries the Reins, ſees whether we are ſo diſpos'd, or no. And, tho' he puts us not to the actual Tryal, he will however Judge us, accordingly as he ſees we are actually diſpos'd. And let this ſuffice for the preſent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you have ſeen, how far we muſt Renounce the World in general, and alſo in that particular Inſtance of its Goods, the Riches thereof. There are ſeveral other Ingredients of which this World does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and in what Sence, and how far you muſt Renounce them, ſhall alſo, God willing, be ſhew'd you.

            <p>THE Point that we are now upon, is to lay before you the Strength of thoſe Temptations, which do ariſe from the <hi>World</hi> in General, and the ſeveral Things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Particular, whether, they be the <hi>Goods,</hi> or the <hi>Evils</hi> thereof, or ſuch as are of a <hi>middle Nature;</hi> and to ſhew you in what Sence, and how far you are to <hi>Renounce</hi> 'em. And as to ſuch Conſiderations, which concern the World in general, and alſo that firſt and principal of its Materials, the <hi>Riches</hi> thereof, and which are neceſſary to he laid before you: This I have already done, and now I am to paſs on to the Conſideration of</p>
            <p>A Second of its Particulars, viz. <hi>The Honours thereof, and to ſhew you what they mean, and in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce the Honours of this World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is meant by the Honours of this World, in whatſence, and how far they are to be Renounced.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Honour is accounted one of the Principal of this World's Goods; and tho' it be much ſupported by Wealth and Riches, yet it is often, and ſometimes deſervedly, prefer'd before 'em. And Honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſtrictly<note place="margin">What is meant by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour properly and ſtrictly.</note> does ſignify an inward Eſteem bore to a Perſon, upon the account of ſome worthy Accompliſhments and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he is poſſeſt of; and this inward Sence of his Worth, teſtified by ſome outward and ſuitable Reſpects, expreſt either by our Carriage towards him, or by our Speeches to, or concerning him. This is what Honour does ſtrictly ſignify: But to the more general and uſual Meaning of the Thing,<note place="margin">What in the General Meaning of the Word.</note> both in Scripture, and common Language, by Honours are alſo meant the Advantages, or Qualities themſelves, upon the account of which Perſons are ſo Honour'd, and Eſteem'd, and Reſpected; and thoſe outward Reſpects given 'em upon the account of thoſe Advantages.</p>
            <p>And they may be reduo'd to theſe following, <hi>Nobility, or Gentility, Preeminence, or Authority,</hi> and Dignities and Promotions, which are call'd Poſts of Honour: Alſo an <hi>High Eſteem and Reputation</hi> amongſt Judicious, Wiſe, and Good Men, upon the account of a Perſon's Wiſdom and Vertue, or ſome worthy and glorious Action perform'd by him: Or, the <hi>Vulgar Applauſe</hi> of the Croud of Men, upon what they account Praiſe-worthy and Honourable: And laſtly, the <hi>Outward Expreſſions of Reſpect, either by Word, or Deed,</hi> uſually given upon the account of any of theſe. I ſhall conſider all theſe

And ſuch Honour as this is highly agreeable both to Scripture, and Reaſon. In the Scriptures we do not only find the <hi>Princes of Iſrael, Heads of the Houſes of their Fathers, who were the Princes of the Tribes, and were over them,</hi> Numb. 7.2. but alſo that they bore ſeveral <hi>Coats of Arms</hi> for Diſtinction, which what they were, you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. And in Reaſon there is as great a Neceſſity, that there ſhould be a Diſtinction of <hi>Members,</hi> more or leſs Honourable in the Body Politick, as in the Natural, and therefore in both, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſome Members we beſtow more abundant Honour,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.23. And indeed ſuch a Diſtinction of Perſons upon the account of their Merit, or Deſert of their Families, does ſerve to raiſe the Emulation of Men, to Atchieve ſome noble and worthy Enterprize, and to ſhake off that Sloth, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Enfeeble their Activity. And for this reaſon it is, that God has Planted this Paſſion of Emulation in Perſons Natures, to rouze 'em up to Imitate the noble Vertues, and great Examples of Others, that they likewiſe might Tranſmit a Name worthy to be Imitated in future Generations. Such is the <hi>Original and Nature of True Nobility,</hi> and ſo Reaſonable and Uſeful it is in it ſelf.</p>

He is moreover by the Eminence of his Birth and Quality, as <hi>A Light put, not under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick,</hi> and ſo the World, who are always apt to imitate the Manners of their Superiors, ſeeing his bad Example, will many of them Copy it out to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſo Miſchievous is ſuch a One amongſt Men. And laſtly, he has receiv'd far greater <hi>Talents</hi> from God, than other Men, to employ to his Glory, which he has abus'd to his Diſhonour, he is ungrateful towards God. He has had the Examples of more noble Progenitors before his Eyes, to raiſe his Emulation; he has had the Advantages of a better Education, to improve his Knowledge; he has more Time and Leiſure to purſue it, more Riches to procure the Means of Attaining it; he has more Authority to ſupport Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Church, and he has a greater ſtock of Reputation amongſt Men, to Countenance both. And having thus a greater ſhare of Talents to employ to his Maſter's Honour, proportionably a greater Meaſure of Improvement thereof, to the Advancement of God's Glory and Religion amongſt Men, will be requir'd at his Hands; <hi>For unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and to whom Men have committed much, of him they will ask the more,</hi> Luk. 12.48.<note place="margin">Such a One is bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others to be a ſtrict and orderly Liver, and upon his Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, is more open to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and more liable to be ſeverely Puniſht.</note> And now does any Man think when he has ſo much Abus'd himſelf, and Family, when his Example has been ſo Miſchievous and Infectious to Mankind, and when he has turn'd all the Artillery, which God has given him to fight againſt Sin, and the Devil, when he has Treacherouſly turn'd it upon God himſelf, will his Honour bear him out in this? Or does he think himſelf above the Reproof of God's Miniſters here, or the Puniſhment of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Deity hereafter? No: He is the Man to whom Reproof does particularly belong, and accordingly <hi>Herod the Tetrarch was reproved by John the Baptiſt, for Herodias, his Brother Philip's Wife, and for the Evils, which Herod had done,</hi> Luk. 3.19. And in the World to come, ſuch a One, above all Men, will be <hi>Beaten with many Stripes,</hi> Luk. 12.47. So much is that Honour to be Renounc'd, which pretends to put a Man above the Laws of God, or Man, or beyond Reproof or Puniſhment for the Violation of 'em.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And ſo likewiſe is that to be <hi>Renounced and Deteſted, which exalts Perſons above their Brethren, to that degree, as to deſpiſe and oppreſs the reſt of Mankind, as if they were but a lower Rank of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and had not the ſame God to their Father, Bodies formed out of the ſame Clay, and Souls as excellent in their Natures, and as capable of Improvements; as precious in God's ſight, and as much the Heirs of Heaven, as their own.</hi>

               <hi>But,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe Perſons ought indeed, even to renounce all Pretenſions to Honour, who have degenerated from thoſe worthy Qualities, which Ennobled their Anceſtors.</hi> The true Nobility of thoſe, who are really of Birth, or Quality, was founded, as I have told you, in the Heroick and extraordinary Vertues of their Anceſtors; and therefore their <hi>Quality</hi> cannot be ſuppos'd to remain with 'em, when thoſe Vertues, which gave Being to it, are departed from 'em. But ſo it is, that none are half ſo apt to Pride themſelves in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and to talk ſo much of their Pedigree, as thoſe who have the leaſt of any true Worth remaining in 'em: And ſure, it is a ſign they have but little of their own, who do ſo much value themſelves upon others Deſervings; and ſeem to have nothing to Brag of, but borrowed Titles. <hi>We have Abraham to our Father,</hi> was the conſtant Cry of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they had leaſt of the Faith and Vertues of <hi>Abraham.</hi> However, as apt as ſuch are to aſſume this Honour to themſelves, there is no reaſon in the World, but what was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd by the Merits of others, ſhould be forfeited by their ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40806:85"/> and that Vice ſhould loſe, what Vertue did gain.

The Honour of my Houſe beginneth with me, and the Honour of thine, endeth with thee, ſaid a worthy Commander, in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to a Baniſht Wretch, who upbraided him with the meanneſs of his Parentage.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>And ſuch ought alſo, even to Renounce all Pretenſions to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, amongſt Chriſtians at leaſtwiſe, who deſpiſe Religion and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities beneath them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lastly, and ſuch ought to Renounce all Pretenſions to Honour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at leaſt-wiſe, who deſpiſe Religion and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath 'em.</note> And yet thoſe are the Perſons, who take themſelves to be the only Men of Honour, who can talk moſt Atheiſtically and Profanely, whoſe Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is made up of Lewdneſs and Debauchery; and as to thoſe grand diſtinguiſhing Graces of Chriſtianity, Humility, Meekneſs, and a patient Enduring of Injuries and Affronts, who count them a meer Jeſt, which Men of Quality and Honour, it is impoſſible, ſhould ſubmit to. But be it ſo, only let 'em withal conſider, that <hi>Not many Mighty, not many Noble were called; but the baſe things of the World, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things which are,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.28. And what then ſignifies their Honour, when God deſpiſes it?</p>
            <p>But really it is not ſo, that your profligate and lewd Livers, be their Birth, or Quality never ſo Great, are Honour'd and Reſpected amongſt Men; for whilſt they continue in a mean and vile Slavery to their baſeſt Luſts, they are not only in truth and reallity miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched Caitiffs: But whatever they think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are indeed in the Eyes of others moſt Hateful and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. True it is, the greateſt Part of Men (and Pity it is, that ſo many amongſt Chriſtians ſhould ſtill remain ſo Carnally minded) do look upon the Man, who will not revenge an Affront, to be mean Spirited, and ſcarcely a Gentleman; and the deſperate Duelliſt is the more Honourable and Heroick in the Eye of the World: Yet thoſe who are throughly ſeaſon'd with Religion, and Wiſdom's Dictates, have other Thoughts and Apprehenſions of ſuch a One, and count him the only Perſon of true Courage, and of a great Soul, who can deſpiſe the vain Opinions of the Croud, in the Purſuit of real Vertue.

And it is either that, which is the Cauſe of farther Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, viz. <hi>The Favour of Princes;</hi> or the Honours themſelves, which they Confer'd upon Perſons deſerving their Favours, as <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> and <hi>Authority, Dignities</hi> and <hi>Promotions,</hi> which are uſually call'd <hi>Poſts of Honour:</hi> As alſo thoſe <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> which do commonly accompany, and go along therewith, and are the Effect of Princes Favours.</p>
            <p>Now as to both theſe, there is no doubt, but in themſelves they are Good and Uſeful, and may be very Advantagious to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Religion; for the more a Man is in his <hi>Princes Favour,</hi> and the greater is his Authority and Truſt; the more he is ſupported with Power and Pre-eminence, and the greater Figure he makes in the World, the more capable he ſhall be of protecting true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of rewarding and encouraging Piety and Vertue, and of diſcountenancing and caſheering Wickedneſs and Vice, as was ſeen in the Favour of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> with King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Heſt. 8. But then except the Mind be firſt well ſeaſon'd with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion and Vertue, and ballaſted with Humility, Princes Favours, High Places, Precedences and Titles give great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

They bring many humble Petitioners to wait upon 'em; and theſe are the Men, who keep the World in ſubjection and awe under 'em. And therefore in obtaining a Prince's Favour, many are tempted to the groſſeſt Flattery, in keeping it to the moſt ſervile and ſinful Compliances; and rather than loſe it, to Sacrifice Innocence, and a good Conſcience. And as to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themſelves, the Glory thereof Tempts ſome to graſp after 'em, who have no Abilities, nor Skill to manage 'em; the Denial often cauſes thoſe, who have real Abilities, but know it too well, to turn <hi>Male-contents</hi> and <hi>Mutineers</hi> to the Shocking many times of Church and State. And moſt Men are tempted to aſpire after 'em, meerly to ſerve their own Private Ends, not the Publick Good, by 'em: And laſtly, to compaſs and purchaſe 'em by moſt indirect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Means. In the Poſſeſſion of 'em, Perſons are apt to grow Proud and Imperious, Unjuſt and Cruel, and at the beſt ſhall be much diverted from minding the great Buſineſs of their Souls. And laſtly, the hazard of loſing 'em are dangerous Temptations to many to <hi>Obey Man, rather than God,</hi> that they may ſtill Retain 'em.</p>

It is the Ambition of Great Men, ſtriving with one another for the higheſt Places of Truſt and Power in the Common-wealth, that cauſes Factions, and Civil Wars, to the Deſtruction of their Native Country. And it is the Pride of ſome, who over-valuing their own Abilities and Parts, and thinking they are Injur'd, in not being Prefer'd to the higheſt Dignities and Promotions in the Church, has cauſed thoſe <hi>Schiſms and Separations</hi> in it; ſuch chooſing rather to be <hi>Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders</hi> of a Party, than Subject to, and <hi>Dependant</hi> on any. But tho' theſe publick Poſts in Church, or State may be modeſtly ſought by thoſe, who are able to weild 'em, and need not be renounc'd and declin'd by Men of Parts and Abilities, when duly call'd thereto:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40806:87"/> Yet none of the greateſt Capacities ought violently to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into 'em, to the Diſturbance of Church, or State, <hi>Leſt they periſh in the Gain-ſaying of Korah,</hi> who with his Companions, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> unduly and factiouſly ſeeking the Prieſthood, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.10.

The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and Effects of Faction and Schiſm, are ſo very bad, that it is not to be wonder'd, God ſhould ſo remarkably Puniſh it, as he did, to the Example of Others.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Wherefore a Perſon of the beſt Capacities and Abilities, if after ſome reaſonable Expectations, and a modeſt Importunity, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet hope to prevail, he muſt ſubmit to Authority and Order, acknowledg God's Providence in it, poſſeſs his Soul in patience, and think that for ſome ſecret Corruption in himſelf, or for ſome other juſt Cauſe, God is pleas'd that he ſhould not at all, or not yet ſucceed in his Suit.</q> So that thus you ſee, how in the Purſuit of Civil Honour, as High Places, and Poſts of Honour, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Dignities, and Promotions, that no Man muſt graſp at thoſe, which he has not Abilities, or Skill to manage; nor muſt Perſons of greateſt Abilities turn Male-contents and Mutineers againſt the Government, in Church, or State, when defeated in their Aims: But as they may modeſtly endeavour their own Advancement, ſo they muſt contentedly receive a Denial, when for Reaſons, beſt known to their Superiors, they are put by their Pretenſions. And this is all that is proper for me to ſpeak as to the <hi>Renouncing</hi> of this ſort of Honour; it being not my Buſineſs to <hi>Catechize</hi> my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, but rather to Inſtruct you, that you may be obedient both to God, and Them. To proceed then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is another ſort of Honour, conſiſting in the high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Reputation, on which the wiſe and vertuous Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of a Perſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>occaſion'd by the excellent Qualities, and Divine Graces ſhining in him, or upon the account of ſome extraordinary Actions performed by him.</hi> And this indeed is a Subject, which it concerns all of you to have well ſtated to you, there being no Chriſtian but has, or ought to have a good Reputation, for his good and excellent Qualities. And by what meaſures he ought to <hi>Gain,</hi> to <hi>Enjoy,</hi> or to <hi>Retain</hi> it; and when, how far, and in what Sence he is bound to deny himſelf in, or to decline it, is what belongs therefore to every One to be ſatisfy'd about.</p>
            <p>Now this is that Honour, which the Wiſe-man calls a <hi>Good Name,</hi> Prov. 22.1. and tells us, it <hi>is rather to be choſen, than great Riches, and that loving Favour is better than Silver and Gold.</hi> And yet to give us a higher Commendation of it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.1. he tells us, that a <hi>Good Name is better than precious Ointment.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> Now that he does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and prefer it to precious Ointment, the reaſon very likely is this, becauſe in the firſt place, precious Ointment was a moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Treaſure in the Eaſtern Nations, as appears by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſhewing it in a vain Oſtentatious manner amongſt the reſt of his choiceſt Treaſures, thoſe in the <hi>Houſe of his precious things,</hi> to the Babyloniſh Ambaſſadours, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.13. Next it was what was uſed in the Conſecration of Perſons to the higheſt Dignities and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40806:88"/> Employments, as to the Pre-eminence of a King, and the Office of the High Prieſthood, as you will ſee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.32. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.16. It was what caſt forth, far and near, a moſt fragrant and delicious Scent to the Comfort of others, and of thoſe, who were Anointed with it; for no ſooner had <hi>Mary anointed the Feet of Jeſus with her coſtly Ointment, but the houſe was filled with the Odour of it,</hi> Joh. 12.3. Oyls and Ointments were what Wreſtlers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wont to uſe to prepare 'em for the Combat; for being of a piercing Nature, when Chafed in, they would ſupple the Joints and ſtrengthen the Sinews very much, <hi>It ſhall enter like Oyl into thy Bones,</hi> Pſal. 109.18. and thereby greatly enable the Body for Action, make it Nimble, and Vigorous, and fit for noble Exerciſes. And laſtly, they were wont anciently to Embalm the Bodies of their Dead therewith, as you may ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. to preſerve 'em, even after Death, from Stench and Corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It is a more peculiar Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than any the greateſt Treaſures, and procures better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our Perſons and Eſtates.</note>And now the Advantages of a Good Name have ſomething there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſembling, but indeed far exceeding each of theſe, ſo as to render it much better than precious Ointment. For in the firſt place, an excellent Reputation and Fame for extraordinary Perfections, Divine Graces, and vertuous Performances, is infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the moſt moſt precious Treaſures; for beſides that, it is a more peculiar Bleſſing, than large Mannors and Poſſeſſions, Banks of Gold, or Silver, than Indian Stones, and all things that are accounted precious by Worldlings and Uſurers; for theſe are things which are common to the worſt, as well as beſt of Men: Beſides this, I ſay, an high Eſteem and Reputation for Goodneſs, is a better Security by far, than the greateſt Wealth. Now the Fundamental reaſon of ſome Men's amaſſing ſo much Wealth together, is becauſe they think they ſhall provide thereby againſt all the ill Events of Fortune, and ſhall have wherewithal to fend for themſelves in times of difficulty and ſcarcity of Friends. But whereas in Dearths, Famines, Perſecutions, and Invaſions, the more Wealthy any Man is, the more he is the Object of Envy, and ſubject to Rapine and Violence: The very Reputation of Uprightneſs and Integrity, Goodneſs, Mercy, Charitableneſs, will be a ſafe Retreat and Shelter againſt the Storm. And this alone has deliver'd many a One from Injuries, and Barbarous Uſage, whom bolted Doors, and barr'd Gates, and Armed Men to guard 'em, could not protect againſt the Inſults of an Enraged Multitude, and the Plunders of an Intruding Souldiery.</p>

For which reaſon the Wiſe man tells us, Prov. 15.13. <hi>That a good Report maketh the Bones fat,</hi> whereas a Perſon labouring under the Infamy of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vices, has both his own Conſcience, and other Men's Contempt of him, piercing him to the very Soul. And with reſpect to others,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40806:88"/> A <hi>Good Name</hi> ſends forth a Savour more ſweet,<note place="margin">And ſmells ſweet in the World.</note> than the moſt <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ointments,</hi> to the Delight of all that are round about him; whereas the very Name of an Unjuſt Oppreſſor and Exactor, of a Riotous and Debaucht Liver, of a Knaviſh, or Perfidious Villain, is a Nuſance and Offence to the Neighbourhood he dwells in, and he is Hated farther than he was ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay? A Good Name and Reputation in the World,<note place="margin">It renders a Perſon capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing Good in it.</note> renders a Perſon capable of doing Good amongſt Men. It gives Weight to his Counſels, Authority to his Reproofs: Nay, and not only his Preſence, but the very Imagination that he is Preſent, is enough to give a Check to any baſe and unworthy Action, or wicked Deſign. <hi>Becauſe I delivered the Poor that cryed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and him that had none to help him, unto me men gave Ear and waited, and kept Silence at my Counſel,</hi> Job 29.12.21. Whereas if a Perſon of known, or but ſuſpected Vices, tho' Backt with the Power of a Maſter, of a Parent, nay of a Magiſtrate, if ſuch a One pretends to correct Sin, or to enjoin the ſtrict Obſervation of any Duty, that Part of Religion is thought the worſe of, and ſlighted the more for his concerning himſelf about it. And as a Good Name renders a Man capable of doing much Good, ſo to have the Approbation of others to his worthy Deſigns, puts Life and Vigour into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for the Publick.<note place="margin">And active in Promoting it.</note> It makes him Active and Zealous in the Proſecution of 'em, and gives Refreſhment to his tired Thoughts and Spirits, under the Fatigues of compaſſing 'em. And to Crown all, when ſuch a One comes to Die, his Death is lamented as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Loſs, or ſome Judgment befall'n the Age, or Place, which was not worthy of him. His Memory is ſweet and precious, whereas that of the Infamous ſtinks worſe than his very Carcaſs; or as the Wiſe-man ſays, <hi>The Memory of the Juſt is bleſſed, but the Name of the Wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 10.7. So Valuable in it ſelf, is that ſort of Honour, which conſiſts in the high Eſteem and Reputation of the Wiſe and Vertuous Part of Mankind, concerning a Perſon, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the excellent Qualities and divine Graces ſhining in him, or upon the account of ſome extraordinary Actions perform'd by him. And yet for your farther Satisfaction,<note place="margin">A deſire of Reputation, and Credit, is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our Natures by God.</note> that it is not only in it ſelf a valuable Bleſſing, but may with due Regulations be deſir'd, enjoy'd, and carefully retain'd by us, I am to tell you, That God himſelf, who is not the Author of Sin, has implanted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every Man a love of his Credit, and a deſire to have a Good Name amongſt Wiſe and Vertuous Perſons; and this the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has done, that this deſire of Credit and Reputation might be a Spur to excite us to Vertuous Performances, and a Bridle to reſtrain us from laſhing out into Sinful Extravagances. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is Good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame,</hi> Rom. 13.3.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Laſtly, It is a Duty incumbent upon all Chriſtians,<note place="margin">And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected of Evil, is a Duty enjoin'd us by his Laws.</note> to preſerve their Reputation <hi>untainted,</hi> and, as much as poſſible, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected</hi> of Evil. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Be blameleſs, ye Sons of God, without Rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom ſhine ye as Lights in the world.</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. we are Enjoin'd to <hi>Abſtain from all Appearance of Evil.</hi> Some will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, ſo they can but Approve their Conſciences to God, they care

But beſides that, ſeldom any grow ſhameleſs and regardleſs of their Credit, till they have loſt all ſence of Conſcience, as well as of their Honour: This is at beſt but a very uncharitable Saying. It is every Man's Duty indeed, in the firſt place, to take care of doing any thing, that is in it ſelf Evil, and by which God is offended; and if he cannot diſcharge his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to him in a Good thing, without incurring the Offence and and Cenſures of Men, he muſt in ſuch Caſe be content to approve his Actions to God only. But in Charity to other Men's Souls, we muſt alſo with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.16. <hi>Exerciſe our ſelves to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Conſcience void of offence, as towards God, ſo towards men,</hi> by giving no occaſion to ſuſpect us of Evil, and that becauſe of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Offence, <hi>Leſt our liberty become a ſtumbling Block to them that are Weak, and an occaſion of falling in our Brother's way,</hi> which we are Caution'd againſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <q>Beſides, that if a Perſon be of ill Fame, tho' he may not deſerve it, all his Speeches and Actions ſhall be ill Interpreted, no Man regards what he ſays, or does, his Propoſals ſhall be ſuſpected, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Rebukes, tho' wholſome and juſt, ſcorn'd and deſpis'd; the Man he ſpeaks for, the ſide he adheres to, the Cauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and the Buſineſs he manages ſhall ſuffer Prejudice, and ſpeed the worſe for the ill Opinion is held of him.

When poſſeſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Eſteem, we are apt to take it wholly to our ſelves, and not to refer it to God, to whom the Glory of all that is Good in us, does properly belong; and to make it an Inſtrument of our own Advancement only, neglecting to uſe the Authority, which our Credit and Reputation in the World does give us, to diſcountenance Irreligion, and to encourage Piety in the World. And ſometimes Perſons do ſo much over-value their Good Name and Reputation amongſt Men, as to fly to undue Means of preſerving it; nay, to prefer the Eſteem of Men more than the Honour, that cometh from God: In all which Caſes there is great occaſion for that Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and Self-denial, with reſpect to that Honour, which conſiſts in an High Eſteem and Reputation amongſt Men.</p>

And indeed ſo far ſhould we be from affecting the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Applauſes of Men upon the account of anything well done by us, that it becomes us rather to walk as ſilently and retiredly in the ways of Vertue, as we can, never endeavouring Oſtentatiouſly to publiſh and proclaim our Pious and Good Performances, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Fame and Popularity, and modeſtly concealing our own Praiſes and Excellencies: But when either the Glory of God, or the good of our Brother is concern'd and promoted in the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Letting our Light ſhine before Men,</hi> then, and to the End only, <hi>that others ſeeing our good Works, they may Glorify our Father, which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.16. For as One well obſerves, <q>We are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affect thoſe things, which deſerve Fame, than the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fame it ſelf; becauſe Honour muſt be the Effect and Fruit of Well-doing, and not the chief Motive, or final Cauſe: Or, as <hi>Seneca</hi> expreſſes it, It is good to be Praiſed, but better to be Praiſe-worthy.</q> But then if our Reputation and Praiſe does come in here, it is deſirable enough, and is very ſeaſonable, and comes in its due place, as being ſubordinate to God's Glory. And indeed it is moſt ſucceſsfully obtain'd, when leaſt ſought after; every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the moſt worthy Performances, when they ſee a Man aim thereby at ſo low a Mark, as Humane Praiſe and Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We muſt not Affect, but Renounce and Refuſe thoſe Praiſes, which are beyond, or above our Deſerts.</hi>

And to this End muſt therefore take care of Self-love, which makes us to magnify our own Parts, and to leſſen thoſe of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Perſons, who have a great Reputation and Eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, upon the account of ſome worthy Performances, <hi>Muſt beware of taking the Honour thereof wholly to themſelves, and of not Transferring it to God,</hi> to whom the Glory of all that is Good in us, or excellently perform'd by any of us, does properly belong.<note place="margin">

And ſo muſt all of us do, and inſtead of Glorying in our ſelves, muſt Glory in the Lord, and ſay, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 115.1. And the reaſon thereof is, that the good Temper of our Souls is wrought in us by the Grace of his Holy Spirit; and if we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any worthy Deſign, beſides that, it is owing to his Grace aſſiſting us, it is owing alſo to his Providence, which orders all thoſe lucky Hits, and favourable Circumſtances, and all thoſe other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, whereby we do bring it to Perfection: For <hi>Every good and perfect Gift cometh from above,</hi> Jam. 1.17. and, <hi>What is it that we have not received?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. <q>We are not forbid to receive Honour,

            <p>
               <hi>You muſt Renounce and Abhor,</hi> I ſay, <hi>that profane Hypocriſy of thoſe, who make their Reputation for Religion a meer Engine to ſcrew themſelves up into places of Power, and an Inſtrument to promote their Trade only.</hi> This is the known Policy of a great many, who when they have a mind to uſurp the Places of their Governours, put up to be great Zealots for Reformation of Religion and Manners; and when they have a deſign to Engroſs to themſelves all the Trade of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, turn over to ſome Demure and Phariſaical Sect, that makes greater Pretences and outward Shews of Godlineſs, than their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but modeſt Neighbours. But for any Perſon to preſume to make ſo ſacred and venerable a Thing, as Religion really is, a meer Tool and Engine to mount themſelves into the higheſt Poſts and Promotions, into Buſineſs and Trades, is ſo Sacrilegious, ſo Prophane an Impiety, ſuch an Aggravated, ſuch a provoking Pitch of Wickedneſs, that if Hell be heated, as the <hi>Babylonian Furnace</hi> was, <hi>ſeven times</hi> hotter than ordinary, for any ſort of Sinners, ſurely it muſt be for thoſe, who do proſtitute the Honour of God and Religion to ſuch vile Purpoſes. And this therefore is a Practice, which muſt of all things in the World be deteſted by you. Certain it is, the mild JESUS was never known to utter Himſelf with ſo much Indignation and Anger, as towards thoſe ſort of Men, who made the Pretences of Religion, a meer Inſtrument to ſerve their Ambition and Covetouſneſs. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye devour Widows Houſes, and for a Pretence make long Prayers, therefore ye ſhall receive the greater Damnation,</hi> Matth. 23.14. So that far be it from any of you, to make ſo Sacred and Venerable a thing, as Religion, an Inſtrument only of Ambition and getting Wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you muſt uſe that Authority, which your Credit and Reputation for Religion may give you, to diſcountenance Vice, and to encourage Vertue in the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">But muſt uſe the Authority our Credit gives us to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Vice, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Vertue in the World.</note> A Perſon of approv'd Sincerity, and of known Piety, has upon that very account, a very great Power over the Hearts and Minds of Men, as I have told you; ſo that he can eaſily Mould 'em into the like Temper with himſelf, if he will but ſeriouſly apply himſelf to that Purpoſe. And to this Purpoſe therefore you muſt uſe that Credit, Reputation, and Authority you ſhall have with Men, who think well and honourably of you, namely, to pull 'em back from running headlong in a Courſe of Sin, and as Allurements to entice 'em to follow your Example in thoſe Vertues and good Parts, for which you your ſelves ſhall be ſo Commendable. It is a Talent God has committed to you, to Trade withal for his Glory, and if

As to the former, That Perſon, who Challenges his Slanderer to give him Satisfaction, as he calls it, in the way of Duel, he ſeems to me to take the ready way to confirm the World in the Opinion, that he was not Injur'd. The worſt his Adverſary could ſay of him, was ſomething which ſpoke him a very Ill Man; and herein he goes about to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the worſt of Men, even a Murderer of his Neighbour, and a <hi>Felo de,</hi> and conſequently one that might not be unlikely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other Wickedneſs. But if it ſhould take off the Scandal from him, in the Opinion of a fooliſh World, what Comfort will that afford, when it is certain, that <hi>No Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.15.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſo agreable to that forbearing and forgiving Temper,<note place="margin">Going to Law thereupon u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual amongſt common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> which ſhould be in every Chriſtian, to go to Law upon words of Slander. <hi>Now therefore there is utterly a Fault amongſt you, becauſe ye go to Law one with another; why do you not rather take Wrong?</hi> That is, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Treſpaſs and Fraud, if the Loſs may be ſupported, or in Caſes of Slander, wherein generally ſpeaking, there is a much more effectual way of clearing an injur'd Innocence, than by Impleading of the Slanderer before a Magiſtrate: Why in ſuch Caſes do you not rather take Wrong? I ſay, in ſuch Caſes there is generally a much more effectual way of clearing an injur'd Innocence, than by Impleading of the Slanderer before a Magiſtrate. For beſides that, this ſort of Lawing ſeems in moſt, a piece of Revenge in the Party traduc'd, upon his Accuſer, for diſcovering ſome ſecret Wickedneſs, which he was aſhamed to have publiſht, rather than with any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or Hopes of clearing his Innocence; inſomuch that he who comes off Triumphantly from the Juſtice of Peace, is ſeldom the better thought of in the Neighbourhood, and ſtill they will be apt to think it was a Work of Darkneſs, and only wanted a ſufficient Proof: Beſides this, I ſay, an open and plain Diſcovery before Neighbours, of the falſhood and malice of the Slanderer in the moſt mild and Chriſtian way; or if ſuch a Diſcovery cannot be made, a Circumſpection and Care to live ſo Inoffenſively and Innocently, as no one will believe the Calumny, this will in time work all evil Surmiſes and Suſpicions out of the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>And we muſt utterly Renounce and forfeit the Eſteem of Men, rather than incur the Diſ-favour of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, we muſt utterly Renounce and forfeit the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of Men, rather than incur the diſ-favour of God.</note> The beſt and wiſeſt of Men are but Men ſtill, and do often judge of other Perſons, and their Proceedings, not as they ought, or as God Judgeth. Thus we ſee, <hi>When Jeſus began to ſhew unto his Diſciples, how that he muſt go up unto Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed; then Peter took him up, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40806:91"/> be unto thee,</hi> Matth. 16.21, 22. that is, he endeavour'd earneſtly to diſſwade him from ſo hazardous an Undertaking, and would have him be more careful of himſelf. And ſo it often happens to his faithful Diſciples, eſpecially his Miniſters. If any more than ordinarily Zealous of their Maſter's Glory, or faithful in his Service, ſhall attempt to Reprove a great Man, or to oppoſe the Stream of Wickedneſs, or ſome ungodly, but prevailing Cuſtoms, his Friends, too much ſavouring of worldly Wiſdom, ſhall violently diſſwade him, not to be thus <hi>Righteous over-much,</hi> as they think.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhall ſo happen, that in the Diſcharge of our Duty, we have not their Approbation, be they never ſo Wiſe, or eſteem'd never ſo Vertuous, having in the firſt place with all Sincerity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd what is neceſſary for us to do, we muſt vigorouſly proceed in the Diſcharge of a good Conſcience, let who will condemn us of Raſhneſs, or Imprudence.</p>
            <p>And this is what the Apoſtle commands us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3, 4.8. He bids us <hi>Give no offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed;</hi> that is, he would have us make it, in the firſt place, a ſpecial part of our Care, to Abſtain ſtrictly from all things, that may give any juſt Offence, and Avert any from the Faith; endeavouring to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves to all, that all Men may look on our Behaviour in the Goſpel, with Reverence, and not with Cenſure: And ſo be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a Chriſtian Life, not deter'd from it. But then he charges us withal, <hi>In all things to approve our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much Patience, Affliction, by Honour and Diſhonour, by evil Report, and good Report, as deceivers, and yet true;</hi> that is, he would have us approve our Fidelity in the Diſcharge of our Office by all proper Means, thro' the various Fates of being reproachfully Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, as well as reſpectfully by others, by being Vilified, as well as Commended. So that thus at length you have ſeen, how that that part of Honour, which conſiſts in the Good Eſteem and Reputation of the wiſe and vertuous part of Mankind, tho' it is much to be valued in it ſelf, and may be lawfully Deſir'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably Enjoy'd, and ought carefully to be Preſerv'd: Yet there is great place for Renunciation, with reſpect both to the Attainment and Enjoyment thereof; and particularly as to the Loſs of it, that we muſt ſo far Renounce it, as not to prefer the Eſteem of Men before the Honour, that cometh from God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, And now I am to take into conſideration the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is conferr'd, not by the wiſe and vertuous part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor given always upon the account of good Qualities, and worthy Performances; but the Eſteem of another ſort of Men, and for the moſt part, for quite different Qualities and Performances, viz. <hi>The Applauſes of the Vulgar, and of the Croud of Men, upon the account of what they judge Praiſe-worthy and Glorious.</hi>

            <p>Now by the <hi>Vulgar, and the Croud of Men,</hi> I do not mean barely <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and the lower Rank of Mankind; but alſo that mixt Multitude, or Herd of Men, as well High, as Low, Rich, as well as Poor, all of what Rank, or Degree ſoever, who have little, or no Principles of Religion, or Vertue, all whoſe Apprehenſions of Divine and Religious Matters are mean and low, and not lifted above the common Pitch, and to thoſe Heights and Improvements given us
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40806:91"/> by true <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> Truly all ſuch are accounted the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and ſhall be Herded amongſt the <hi>Croud,</hi> for me, whether they be clad in Silks, or Furs, and fare Deliciouſly every day; or whether they work at the Anvil, or follow the Plow, or beg at our Doors.</p>
            <p>And by their <hi>Applauſes,</hi> I do mean, that Vogue and Suffrage, that Approbation, and whatever other Expreſſions of good liking, which they do commonly give to bad Actions, and ſinful Practices, as Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, Fighting, Duelling, and the like. And theſe Applauſes of theirs, are as common and great a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to moſt of thoſe Sins, which are committed, as any thing whatſoever, and muſt therefore be utterly Renounc'd,<note place="margin">This ſort of Honour muſt be utterly and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> Deteſted, and Abhorr'd by us.</p>
            <p>So that if ever it ſhould ſo happen, that you ſhall unhappily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any of thoſe ſcandalous Sins (which God avert) and any of thoſe profane and unthinking Creatures, who make a Mock, a meer Jeſt of Sin, ſhall Applaud you for the ſame; inſtead of being pleas'd thereat, you muſt take Shame to your ſelf, and let 'em know you are too much griev'd and troubled at your having committed ſuch Folly and Madneſs, to be pleas'd at their Recital and Plaudits given it. No ſure: A Repentance conſiſting in Sorrow and Shame is what ought to follow Sin; but to Glory in it, and to receive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes for it, is infinitely to Aggravate it. And know this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Except you Repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> as many other Sinners, triumphing like Mad-men in their Impieties, have done before you, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>And now Laſtly, it only remains that I lay before you, <hi>In what ſence, and how far you are bound to Renounce thoſe outward Expreſſions and Significations of Reſpect, either by Word or Deed, which are uſually given upon the account of any of the foremention'd Honours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, in what Sence, and how far we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe outward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Reſpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Word or Deed, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are uſually given upon the account of any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> Hitherto we have conſider'd Honour in its internal Parts only, as Birth and Quality, Authority and Dignity, Reputation and Eſteem, either for good, or bad Qualities and Performances; and have ſhew'd you in what Sence either of theſe are to be Renounc'd. And now I am to do the like as to that outward part of Honour, whereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ſignify'd to the Senſes, the Eyes and Ears of men, the Reſpect, which is born to Perſons, upon the account of any of the fore-mention'd Honours.</p>
            <p>And as to theſe outward Significations of Honour, they are made either by <hi>Word,</hi> or by <hi>Deed.</hi> By Word; and they are either <hi>Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of our Veneration and Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Names and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes peculiarly belonging to God, or <hi>Humane Ones,</hi> as Titles of Honour, when we call a Perſon Lord, moſt Gracious, moſt Excellent, moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or the like; or Titles of Reſpect, as when we call a Perſon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo as to the outward Significations of Honour by <hi>Deed;</hi> theſe are again either Divine, as Adoration, or Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Proſtrating our ſelves on the Ground before God, and ſuch other Significations of our moſt exceſſive Self-abaſement in reſpect of him, and our infinite Diſtance from him; or they are Humane, ſuch as may be alſo us'd to Men, as bowing of the Body, bending of the Knee, baring of the Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are Lawful, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and Dutiful ways of expreſſing our Reſpects; and are alſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40806:92"/> neceſſary, according as they are apply'd to Perſons, to whom by the Laws of God, and right Reaſon they are due.</p>
            <p>And now the Queſtion will be, In what Sence, and how far any Perſon is bound to Renounce theſe Honours and Reſpects when conferr'd upon 'em.</p>
            <p>

                  </gap>ections.</note> Thus you'll ſee, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had miraculouſly Heal'd <hi>A Creeple at Lyſtra, who had never walked, the people would have done Sacrifice unto them,</hi> as if they were Gods; but thoſe Good Men no ſooner perceiv'd it, but in the Abhorrence of the Blaſphemy, <hi>Rent their Garments, and ran in upon them to reſtrain them, crying out, and ſaying, Sirs, Why do ye theſe things? We alſo are Men of like Paſſions with your ſelves, and preach unto you, that you ſhould turn from theſe Vanities, to ſerve the living God,</hi> Act. 14.14, 15. And no doubt, but as the Angel alſo refuſed the Worſhip which <hi>John</hi> offer'd him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. So both the Bleſſed Saints and Angels above, do now with the utmoſt Indignation, Renounce that Divine Worſhip given 'em by their Superſtitious Votaries, the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt any Humane Creature forbear to Renounce, ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the utmoſt Deteſtation and Abhorrence thereof, when any of the <hi>Divine Attributes and Perfections</hi> are aſcribed to 'em by the Flattery of ſinful Men; for the want of which Renunciation <hi>Herod</hi> you'll ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.21, 22, 23. was the moſt ſignally puniſht by the Hand of God. <hi>It happened that upon a ſet Day Herod arrayed in Royal Apparel, ſat upon his Throne, and made an Oration unto the People; And they gave a ſhout, ſaying, It is the voice of a God, and not of a Man; and immediately the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the Glory, and he was eaten up of Worms, and gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> that is, becauſe he diſclaimed not that Blaſphemous Flattery of the People, God Executed that remarkable Vengeance upon him. And this ought to be a Warning to thoſe vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Women, who in the Courtſhips that are paid 'em, and the Complements, which are uſually made 'em, do ſuffer even Divine Attributes and Perfections to be aſcribed to 'em.<note place="margin">Women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt with Deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe Blaſphemous Complements, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcrib'd to them.</note> Nay, and theſe they receive, not only without rebuking thoſe that preſume to offer 'em, but with all the Complacence and Satisfaction in 'em. But ſurely this will be required, not only at their Hands, who do ſo Blaſphemouſly Complement 'em, but at theirs alſo, who do patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer God to be ſo much Blaſphemed in their Praiſes; and the ſame Vengeance, which overtook <hi>Herod,</hi> will not fall ſhort of them alſo, if they Renounce and Refuſe not, with the utmoſt Deteſtation, ſuch Impiety. And it is indeed ſo common a ſtrain of Wickedneſs, that I thought it very requiſite to Advertiſe you of it, and ſeriouſly to warn you againſt admitting it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Every Man muſt renounce and refuſe thoſe Titles, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and Precedences, which are not his due, but belong to Perſons above him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Every Man muſt renounce and refuſe thoſe Titles and Reſpects, and Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which are not his due, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above him.</note> A Diſtinction of Titles and Reſpects is neceſſary to keep up Order and Diſtinction of Men, and their Merits; and it is a great Diſorder and Confuſion, when Perſons either Take, or Receive ſuch, as do not belong to 'em: So that one cannot know who is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40806:92"/> High in Rank, or Reputation, or who is Low in the World in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of either. This is what the Wiſe-man complains of, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. as a great Evil, and ſuch as it concerns the Magiſtrate to reſtrain by Law. <hi>There is an Evil, which I have ſeen under the Sun, as an Error, which proceedeth from the Ruler; Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the Rich ſit in low place; I have ſeen Servants upon Horſes, and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, Laſtly, So far muſt any One be from Aſſuming any thing of this Nature above him, that <hi>It becomes every Perſon out of Modeſty, Humility, and good Manners, to decline his due in this kind: And muſt ever Renounce the Entitling and Placing of himſelf, and leave it to others.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, And muſt in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and good Manners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his due in this kind; and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Entitleing of himſelf, and permit that to others.</note> This our Saviour preſcribes, Luk. 14.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>When thou art bid to a Wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt Room, leſt a more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thou be bidden of him; but ſit down in the loweſt Room, that when he that bade thee cometh, he may ſay unto thee, Friend go up higher: Then ſhalt thou have Worſhip in the preſence of them, who are at meat with thee.</hi> And the reaſon of this Appointment of our Saviour's, in ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly trivial a Caſe, was not only to pull down our Ambition and Pride, but to promote Courteſy, and Civility, and good Manners, which are very conſiderable Vertues in Society, and therefore to be ſure of good account in Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But the Contrary to both theſe laſt Inſtances, of Renouncing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reſpects and Honours, is one of the great <hi>Vanities of the World,</hi> which ſhall be more fully ſpoke to under another Head. But yet I muſt not diſmiſs this without anſwering an Objection, or Two.</p>
            <p>It is uſual amongſt other Titles of Princes,<note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Titles of Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> to aſcribe to 'em the Attributes of <hi>moſt Gracious, moſt Religious, moſt Excellent,</hi> and the like; which may ſeem to ſavour too much of that Flattery, for admitting of which <hi>Herod</hi> was Puniſht: And the Abſurdity ſeems to be the greater, if thoſe Princes happen to be Vicious and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. But here it is to be conſider'd, that Princes, and great Magiſtrates, as they are in an Exalted Condition above the reſt of Men; ſo thoſe Titles muſt be given 'em, which ſhall raiſe and maintain a due Veneration towards them, and their Office. And even when the Perſons Inveſted with thoſe Dignities happen to be Cruel and Wicked; yet ſuch Titles, as moſt Gracious, moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, are not un-befitting their Office, tho' they may not ſo well ſuit their Perſonal Character; and it is upon the account of that, that they are given 'em: As it was upon the Score of his Office, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtyl'd <hi>Feſtus,</hi> a Heathen Magiſtrate, <hi>moſt Noble,</hi> Act. 26.25.</p>
            <p>Next it is urged againſt Receiving Titles of Reſpect, thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Be ye not called Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 23.10. But in order to clear this, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that this is an Hebrew Idiom, or manner of Expreſſing, in which Calling and Being, are all one, as <hi>They ſhall call his name Emanuel,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>he ſhall be Emanuel, or God with us.</hi> So here, <hi>Be ye not called Maſters,</hi> is a forbidding of Men to be Maſters one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And in what Sence is this to be underſtood? Why, amongſt the Jews, you muſt know, thoſe who took upon 'em to be Leaders and Teachers, did challenge a blind Obedience from their Diſciples and Followers, and requir'd 'em to give up their Faith, to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40806:93"/> Sway'd by 'em: But our Saviour would have no meer Man pretend to be ſo much a Maſter over Men's Faith, as if he were Infallible; in which Sence to be a Maſter, was our Saviour's Right. But otherwiſe, the Title of Maſter, as it ſignifies no more than a Humane Reſpect, is no more to be refus'd, than that of Father: Which yet, as amongſt the Jews it was uſed to mean ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the School of the Prophets, as no Man ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, was alſo forbid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.9.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is objected againſt Perſons of Quality being Placed, or Seated higher than others in Religious Aſſemblies, from thoſe words of St. <hi>James,</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>If there come into your Aſſembly a man with a gold Ring, in goodly Apparel, and there come alſo a poor man, in vile Raiment; and ye have reſpect unto him that weareth the gay Clothing, and ſay unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and ſay to the poor, Stand thou there, or ſit under my footſtool, Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and become Judges of evil thoughts?</hi> But this Objection will be taken off, and this difficult Place clear'd, if you conſider what is here meant by <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and upon what account <hi>Reſpect of Perſons is forbid to be had to any one in them.</hi> Now by <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is here to be underſtood a Court of Judicature, where Law-ſuits are tryed, for ſo not only the word tranſlated, <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> does elſewhere, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. ſignify; but there are ſeveral Expreſſions in this place, which do determine it here to this Sence; as particularly when thoſe, that order'd the Rich to ſit in a more Honourable Place, and the Poor in a leſs Honourable, are ſaid to have a <hi>Footſtool,</hi> which did belong to Tribunals; and to be Judges of evil Thoughts, that is, partial in their Judgments, Men that thought more of the Perſons, than their Cauſes.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why that ſort of Reſpect of Perſons in their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Aſſemblies, the Placing of the Man of Quality in a higher, the Poorer in a lower Place, which ſeems not to have been ſo material, was notwithſtanding forbid; was becauſe this would have been lookt upon, according to the then Apprehenſions of the Jews, as a Token of Partiality in the Judge: For as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the Place does obſerve, It was provided by a Canon of the Jews, that when a Rich Man, and a Poor have a Suit together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Conſiſtories, either both muſt ſit, or both ſtand in the ſame Rank, to avoid all marks of Partiality. So that this Place forbids not Precedency and Place to be given, or taken, by Perſons that are in Quality, or Authority, above others, either in Church Aſſemblies, or in other Meetings; but only in the Judicial Meetings of thoſe times, and not then, but becauſe that in the then Apprehenſions of Men, ſuch Precedency would ſignify Partiality in the Judge, that ſuffer'd it. So that it remains, that <hi>Titles of Honour, Reſpects and Precedency</hi> may be receiv'd, when duly given. And I thought it requiſite to take off theſe Objections, both to clear theſe miſtaken Places of Scripture, and that you might not refuſe <hi>To pay Honour to whom Honour is due,</hi> which is a Duty upon all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. And which a fooliſh Sect amongſt us do deny, chiefly grounding the Rudeneſs of their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards their Betters, upon the now mention'd places of Scripture, which they wreſt, as they do the other, to their own Deſtruction. Thus much upon this Occaſion.</p>

               <hi>THE Sixteenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
            <p>HAving undertook to give you a particular and diſtinct account, not only of thoſe Temptations, which ariſe from the <hi>World</hi> in general, but alſo from all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things, whether Good or Evil, therein contain'd: And having already ſurvey'd the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> thereof, and diſtinctly ſhew'd you in what Sence, and how far you are to <hi>Renounce</hi> each of them, and every Particular included in them. I come now to conſider,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Pleaſures thereof, and to ſhew you in what Sence, and how far you are alſo to Renounce the Pleaſures of this World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What's meant by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World, in what Sence, and how far they are to be Renounced.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now all Pleaſure, of what Kind ſoever it be, does ariſe from the <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> of the Object with ſome Faculty that can perceive it. And therefore <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in general, <hi>Is that Satisfaction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which any part of our Nature perceives, when its Appetites are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd with what it deſires.</hi> And as both Soul and Body have their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perceptive Faculties and Appetites; ſo the Gratification and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is given to both, do cauſe different kinds of Pleaſure. And accordingly they may all of 'em, I do think, be reduc'd to theſe Four, <hi>Rational, Senſitive, Senſual, and Recreative Pleaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>As to Rational Pleaſure:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Rational Pleaſure is very Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable.</note> 
               <hi>This is that noble Satisfaction and ſweet Delight, which the Soul perceives, when it finds it ſelf Improve in Knowledge, or in Vertue; or when it reflects upon the Good it has done.</hi> As to Knowledge, the moſt delicious Dainties are not ſo truly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Bodily Appetite, as real and uſeful Knowledge is to the Rational; nor is Light more grateful to the Eye, than Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to the Underſtanding. And all uſeful Knowledge, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Divine, ought to be ſought after with all the Study and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry poſſible, and we cannot too much indulge the Appetite, which craves it: Inſomuch that St. <hi>Paul did not ceaſe to pray for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, and to deſire that they might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding,</hi> Col. 1.9. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Vertue, to get the victory over our Paſſions, to ſubdue our Appetites, and the like, yields ſo great and pure a Satisfaction, that Happineſs it ſelf is defin'd to be that <hi>Pleaſure, which the Mind takes in from a ſence of Vertue, and a conſcience of Well-doing; and of conforming all things to the Rules of both.</hi> And then as to that ſence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40806:94"/> of Joy and Comfort, which Vertuous and Heavenly Minds do feel in doing Good; this is exceedingly more Excellent and Exalted, than all worldly and wicked Pleaſures, as is exemplify'd in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who counted it <hi>His meat and drink to do the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work,</hi> Joh. 4.34. which was <hi>To go about doing Good,</hi> Act. 10.28. So excellent a thing is Rational Pleaſure, and ſo much it is our Duty, as well as Intereſt to gratify our ſelves therewith. But yet as Excellent and Heavenly a Pleaſure as this is, there is room for <hi>Renunciation,</hi> even with reſpect to this. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>No Man muſt make the end of his Knowledge to be the meer Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Knowing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But Firſt, no Man muſt make meer Pleaſure the End of his Knowledge.</note> that is, we muſt not ſeek after Knowledge, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Knowledge ſake, and not for the Uſe and Inſtruction of our ſelves, and others. The true End of Knowledge is to direct our ſelves and others thereby to Happineſs both in this, and the other World. And indeed ſuch a Greedineſs, as is ſeen in ſome Men, of ſwallowing up all ſorts of Learning, and not letting others to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, and to be Benefited by it, is but a better ſort of Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Voluptuouſneſs, and ought therefore to be Renounced by every Chriſtian. The greateſt Goods are ever common: They were deſign'd by God to be ſo, and by good Chriſtians they are made ſo. And Knowledge then being a principal <hi>Good,</hi> every good Man is free in Communicating of that, and of Edifying others therewith; and therefore it is requir'd of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſuppos'd to exceed other Men's, that <hi>He be apt to teach,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nor Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt that Satisfaction and Delight, which ariſes from the ſence and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Good and worthy Deeds, be ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are admir'd and applauded for it, as becauſe they are really in themſelves Vertuous.</note>Secondly, And as to that Pleaſure, which ariſes from the Sence and Conſcience of good and worthy Deeds, as much as we may be permitted to reliſh and enjoy it, yet we muſt take care, that our Satisfaction and Delight be more, becauſe we are really Vertuous, and that we do Good, than that we be admir'd and applauded for it; for <hi>We muſt take heed that we do not our Alms,</hi> or whatever other Good, <hi>before Men to be ſeen of them; otherwiſe we have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 6.1. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Senſitive Pleaſure, and that is when the Animal Life, or the Bodily Senſes are gratify'd with thoſe Objects, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to 'em. All Pleaſure,</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>ariſes from the ſuitableneſs and agreeableneſs between the perceptive Faculties, and the Objects that affect them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Senſitive Pleaſure, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> reſults from the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the perceptive Faculties, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, is lawful.</note> And our Bountiful Maker, as he has given the Animal Life many perceptive Faculties, the ſenſes of Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, and Feeling; ſo he has provided ſuitable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for all thoſe ſeveral Faculties, and does allow us to Gratify our ſelves therewith: <hi>For it is good and comely for one to Eat and to Drink, and to enjoy the Good of all his labour that he taketh under the Sun, all the days of his life which God giveth him; for it is his portion,</hi> Eccl. 5.18. Nay, it is very neceſſary, that we ſhould take Pleaſure in gratifying the ſenſible Cravings of our Nature, for if our Palates do not reliſh our Meat, or if our Stomachs refuſe it, we ſhould ſtarve. And indeed the Comforts and Enjoyments of this Life, which we receive from the bountiful Hand of God, is a great ſubject of our Praiſes and Thankſgivings to him. <hi>Thou prepareſt a Table for me in the preſence of mine Enemies; thou anointeſt my Head with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40806:94"/> Oyl, my Cup runneth over,</hi> ſaid Holy <hi>David,</hi> in a great ſence of God's bountiful Goodneſs towards him, in beſtowing upon him ſo many worldly Comforts. Thus theſe Senſitive Pleaſures may be lawfully Enjoy'd by us, and they are only then, and ſo far to be Renounc'd, when they become,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Senſual,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only when they become, Thirdly, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.</note> which when they do, they are indeed the greateſt Temptations the World has to draw us into Sin; and many Thouſands there are, whom when nothing elſe could Corrupt, have been miſerably ſoil'd by the Power of ſenſual Pleaſures: Which what they are, and how far to be Renounc'd, I come now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you.</p>
            <p>And it is then, that theſe <hi>Senſitive Pleaſures,</hi> which otherwiſe would be for the Preſervation and Comfort of our Nature, and the Matter of our Praiſes to God: It is then, I ſay, that they become <hi>Senſual,</hi> and ſo are to be Renounced, when they gratify only our corrupt and depraved Natures. As the ſenſitive Nature craves ſuch things as are ſuitable to it, and are neceſſary to its Preſervation and Comfort in this Life; and ſenſitive Pleaſures are ſuch as ariſe from ſuch allowable Gratifications: So the <hi>Senſual</hi> and Corrupted Nature of Man craves theſe ſenſitive Pleaſures beyond Bounds and Moderation: It prefers 'em before Rational and Divine Pleaſures. It appears to reliſh no Enjoyments like thoſe of Senſe; it gluts it ſelf with ſenſitive Pleaſures, ſo as to ſurfeit on theſe Sweets. Nay, and laſtly, the <hi>Senſual Man</hi> does load and burthen his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therewith, ſo as to render it unfit for he Duties of his Calling and Religion. Theſe are the inordinate Cravings of the ſenſual Nature; and when we gratify this corrupted Nature of ours, to this immoderate Degree, with <hi>Senſitive Pleaſures;</hi> then thoſe Pleaſures which were in themſelves allowable, become <hi>Senſual,</hi> and ſuch as muſt be utterly Renounced by every Chriſtian. And as we will accordingly Renounce <hi>Senſual Pleaſures,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt not prefer Senſitive Ones in our Judgments, or Deſires, either before our ſpiritual Joy in God, or the eternal Joys of his Kingdom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">As Firſt, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em in our Judgments or Deſires, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before our ſpiritual Joy in God, or the eternal Joys of his Kingdom.</note> which is what the Carnal Man does do; <hi>Which is,</hi> I ſay, <hi>what the Carnal Man does do:</hi> 
               <q>For while the Fleſh is the prevailing Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in any Man, he only reliſhes the ſatisfaction of the Senſes: He cannot enjoy God, he cannot delight in doing his Will, no more than a Swine can in clean Paſture, whoſe natural Property inclines him only to wallow in the Mire. But when the Soul is clarify'd and purg'd by the great Refiner, how ſublime and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Pleaſure does it feel in the Love of God, and in his Service! As in natural Feeding, when the Palate is in due Temper, our Taſt commends our proper Food to the Appetite, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to the Stomach; but a foul Stomach diſ-affects the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſpoils the Palate, and the moſt ſavoury and wholeſom Meat is loathſom, when the Diſeaſe is the <hi>Taſter.</hi> Thus if the Soul be in its due Temper, the <hi>Doing the will of God would be our Meat and Drink,</hi> mixt with a ſweeter Pleaſure than thoſe natural Operations are; but the Soul in the unregenerate Man is ſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and Carnaliz'd, that it has no taſt of the pure Delights of Bleſſed Spirits in Communion with God: Like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who deſpis'd the Bread of Angels, and impatiently long'd for the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40806:95"/> Onions and Garlick, and Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </q> But this muſt no be our Temper, but with the Holy Pſalmiſt we muſt be able ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to ſay; <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether; more to be deſir'd are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold, ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb,</hi> Pſal. 19.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And we muſt Renounce it as a great ſign of a ſenſual Spirit, which reliſhes no Enjoyments like thoſe of Sence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> When a Man reliſhes no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments like thoſe of Sence.</note> 
               <hi>When a Perſon is obſerv'd to be wholly in a manner purveying for the Belly,</hi> Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Ordering his Diſhes, always commending, or rather quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with every thing he eats or drinks: No, the Diſcourſes of Philoſophical, wiſe, and vertuous Minds, is even at the very Table of other-gueſs Matters, than of the Excellency of that Diſh, the Poynancy of ſuch a Sauce, or the Flavour of ſuch and ſuch Liquors. And with theſe Epicures we may juſtly Expoſtulate in the words of our Saviour: <hi>Are ye yet without underſtanding? Do ye not yet underſtand that whatever entereth into the mouth goeth into the belly, and is caſt out into the Draught,</hi> Matth. 15.17. And it is ſure a ſign of an Underſtanding below the Excellency of the Soul of Man, to concern it ſelf ſo much about what in few Hours will go down into the Guts, the Sink, and the vileſt part of the Body.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It muſt be Renounced as a high and ſinful Senſuality to glut our Senſes, ſo as to ſurfeit on theſe Sweets.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> When he gluts himſelf, ſo as to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit on theſe Sweets.</note> There is nothing which does more decay Nature, which brings upon us more deſperate and incurable Diſeaſes, and does more precipitate and haſten a ſudden Death, than Exceſs in the Gratifications of Men's Luſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. But this is groſly to abuſe the Creatures of God, which were allowed us only for our Uſe; It is to make but an ungrateful Return to him, for all his Bounties: And is unnaturally to deſtroy our ſelves for the ſake of a paultry Pleaſure, which vaniſheth in the very Enjoyment; of a Pleaſure, which is mixed with more bitter Ingredients than Gall and Wormwood: <hi>For even in their Laughter the heart of thoſe ſenſual Men is ſorrowful, and the end of their mirth is heavineſs,</hi> Prov. 14.13.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Deliciouſneſs of thoſe Pleaſures muſt not cauſe any one to load and burthen his Nature therewith, to that Degree, as to render him unfit for the Duties of his Calling and Religion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">And laſtly, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs of of theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cauſes him to load and burthen his Nature therewith, ſo as to render him unfit for the Duties of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Calling, and Religion.</note> in which reſpect thoſe do Offend, who do ſo immoderately indulge the Appetites in Eating and Drinking, that they are drowſy and ſleepy even under the Meſſages ſent them from the King of Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd them by his Ambaſſadours, the Preachers of his Word. No, the End of all Pleaſure, as well as of <hi>Recreations,</hi> is to render us not leſs, but more vigorous and lively in the Service of God, and the proper Buſineſs of our Calling: Which brings me,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>To conſider Recreative Pleaſures, and to ſhew you what they are, in what ſence, and how far we are to Renounce thoſe ſort of Pleaſures.</hi> Now theſe are meerly of a middle, and of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature.<note place="margin">Recreative Pleaſures of a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le and indifferent Nature.</note> They are neither wholly Mental, nor altogether Bodily Pleaſures, but may be either. And they are neither neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Good, nor Evil, but either one, or other, according as they are uſed: For when the Mind has been long intent upon Study and Meditation, it may be very convenient to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbend</hi> it, by giving
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40806:95"/> our ſelves ſome bodily Diverſion, as Walking, Riding, or other innocent Recreation. And when the Body has been long fatigued and wearied with Labour, it is requiſite to give it Eaſe; and it is no wiſe hurtful, either to Soul or Body, to fall into a chearful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be an innocent Converſation. And indeed the moderate uſe of innocent Pleaſures and Recreations is both uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It enlivens Nature, brisks up our Spirits, and renders us more able to ſet again about ſerious Buſineſs and Employment. For to intermix no Gratifications, nor Diverſions with our more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Affairs, makes the Mind unactive, dull, and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Recreations,</hi> the moſt innocent of 'em, are to be <hi>moderately</hi> and <hi>ſparingly</hi> us'd<note place="margin">The moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are to be ſparingly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> by every Chriſtian; for he that ſhall much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in the allowed Pleaſures of the World, ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring himſelf into a Frame of Spirit, that will not eaſily endure Patience, Self-denial, and Mortification, and other the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and conſiderable Parts of Religion. Eaſe and Diverſions ſoften the Sinews, diſſolve the Nerves, and are apt to render us Nice, and Delicate, and Effeminate, a Temper the moſt unſuitable for any Souldier, becauſe it will utterly indiſpoſe him for Military Severities. Eaſe and Pleaſure therefore muſt be warily Indulg'd to, by the Souldier of JESUS, in whoſe Warfare there are both Conflicts and Severities, far ſurpaſſing the hardeſt, which other Wars engage us in.</p>
            <p>No, if you will become Excellent in Religion, nay, keep but within the Bounds of Innocence, you muſt innure your ſelves much to Chriſtian Severity and Reſervedneſs; and the moſt harmleſs of this World's Delights are to be more rarely us'd, than is commonly thought of. He that conſtantly eats a full Meal, will not endure a Day of Faſting; and he that does not ſometimes deny himſelf in lawful Enjoyments, will be hardly able to Reſiſt a Temptation to immoderate Gratifications. But however, no Man ſhould make Sports his Buſineſs, nor Paſtimes his Employment, no more than Cordials his Drink, nor Sauces his Meat. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under Heaven; there is a time to weep, as well as a time to laugh; a time to mourn, as well as a time to dance,</hi> Eccl. 3.1.4. And therefore ſuch, who think they have nothing elſe to do with their Time, muſt conſider, that they have that precious Talent given 'em to greater Ends, than to waſt it in Divertiſements.</p>
            <p>Nay, and thoſe whoſe Ample Fortunes in the World put them above the common Condition of Mankind, and are not to eat of their Bread in the ſweat of their Brows, need not live by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and a Calling, would do well to conſider, that the greateſt part of their Time ought to be laid out in doing Good in the World; in being Uſeful and Beneficial to the Society whereof they are Parts and Members. In enquiring into the Neceſſities of their poorer Brethren; in contriving Ways and Means, both to Employ and Relieve 'em. And above all, in promoting Religion, and the Honour of God amongſt Men, ſo far at leaſt, as their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power reaches, whether in their Families, or amongſt their Tenants, Neighbours and Dependants. And theſe are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which will yield both Satisfaction here, and will be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40806:96"/> rewarded with eternal Joys hereafter. Theſe are Employments and Pleaſures both, and (which Pleaſures ſeldom do) will turn to good Account hereafter. And thus I have at length finiſht all that I think neceſſary to ſay to you, concerning Renouncing either the <hi>World</hi> in general, or thoſe particular <hi>Good things,</hi> into which it is divided, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Riches, Honours,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of it. There was great variety of uſeful Matter to be conſider'd under theſe ſeveral Heads, and therefore I have been the longer upon 'em: I ſhall be more ſhort upon the reſt. The next of which are,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Evils</hi> of the World, viz. <hi>Poverty, Diſgrace,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Evils of the World are Poverty, Diſgrace, &amp; Affliction.</note> Theſe are oppoſite to the other <hi>Goods,</hi> and they are Inſtruments, whereby Satan, our great Adverſary, does Attack us, when the other fail him, as is eminently ſeen in the Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>But theſe are not ſo ſucceſsful to Ruine us, as thoſe, which are call'd the <hi>Good things</hi> of the World, commonly are. There is leſs Variety in the ways wherein theſe do Tempt us. And we do not open the Gates of our Souls to theſe, as we do to the Enjoyments of this World: But do rather fortify our ſelves againſt them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is Temptations in theſe alſo, and I will conſider 'em as briefly as I can, and how they are to be Reſiſted by us. To proceed then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions;</hi> (for I ſhall not conſider theſe Two altogether apart, the Temptations that either give us, being much the ſame) Theſe indeed, inſtead of Temptations to Sin, and Hindrances to Vertue, do very often prove Mortifiers of Vice, and the great occaſions of a Holy Life.<note place="margin">Poverty and Afflictions, inſtead of Temptations to Sin, and Hindrances to Vertue, do very often prove Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of Vice, and the great occaſions of a holy Life.</note> For beſides that in a State of Adverſity and Want, we are not ſo ſubject to Pride, Inſolence, and a Contempt of Religion; nor ſo liable to Luxury, Ambition, and Covetouſneſs, and many other Sins, which are too often the Effects of a proſperous and flouriſhing Condition: The divers ſorts of Afflictions and Adverſities, as Sickneſs, Loſs of Goods, and of Friends, Poverty and Want, and the like, are naturally Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and do mightily tend to the Encreaſe of many the moſt precious Graces in the ſight of God, as might be eaſily made appear. Theſe wean us from the World, and inſtead of <hi>Setting our affections on things below,</hi> they do cauſe us to <hi>put our affections on things above.</hi> Seeing the Vanity, Emptineſs, Tranſitorineſs, and great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this World's Enjoyments, we are apt to thirſt after thoſe Permanent, Certain and Everlaſting Joys, prepared in Heaven for us. When Afflictions, and Want, and all other Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations fail us, we do then uſually betake our ſelves to God, for Comfort and Support. And thus drawing nigh unto God we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with him, and he then vouchſafes us ſome Taſts of ſpiritual Delights and Pleaſures. And then having Experienc'd the ineffable Satisfactions, communicated to Pious and Humble Souls in their Devotions, and Religious Exerciſes, we become Heavenly Minded, weary of this World, <hi>And deſirous to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> Thus, I ſay, Afflictions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities are many times, next under God's Grace, great Helps to Piety and Devotion.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40806:96"/>
            <p>Nevertheleſs they are alſo very often great Temptations to many Sins and Impieties,<note place="margin">Nevertheleſs they are often great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to many Sins &amp; Impieties.</note> and as ſuch Satan does uſe 'em. They are apt to breed in us Impatience and Diſcontent, and Envy at the outward Felicity of the Wicked. And Poverty in particular, when it meets with Minds ill-diſpos'd, and not ſeaſon'd with Principles of Vertue and Honeſty, Tempts 'em to Fraud and Theft. And generally when Perſons labour under Neceſſities and Wants, they think they have enough to do to provide Neceſſaries for Themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; that they may therefore diſpenſe with the Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that it is enough for the Rich Ones to frequent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Sacraments. But in the</p>
            <p>Firſt Place, it behoves ſuch, who labour under Poverty, or any Kind of Affliction, to beware they be not Tempted to Impatience and Diſcontent.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> It behoves thoſe, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under Poverty, or any kind of Affliction, to beware of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and Diſcontent.</note> And there is little Reaſon we ſhould be Tempted thereby into theſe Sins; for, in good Truth, theſe Kind of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in moſt Men's Caſes, are Tokens of God's Fatherly Love and Kindneſs, and of his Ordering all things for our Good. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> This is as great a Paradox to Fleſh and Blood, as it is to a Child to be under the Diſcipline of the Rod and Ferula; to either of which, <hi>No Chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be Joyous, but Grievous: Nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fruit of Righteouſneſs to them, which are exerciſed thereby,</hi> ver. 11. Theſe afflicting Providences tend to mortify our Vanity, and to take of our Confidences in worldly Things, which the Soul of Man in Affluence and Abundance is extreamly ſubject to, and than which there is ſcarcely a more ſinful Temper of Mind: Such Reaſon had <hi>David</hi> Thankfully to Acknowledge God's Goodneſs in 'em. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me,</hi> Pſal. 119.75.

Why that <hi>Pride compaſſed them as a Chain, and that Violence cover'd them as a Garment; they ſet their Mouth againſt the Heavens, and their Tongue walked through the Earth;</hi> that is, they became horridly Wicked and Profane upon it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.9. And are theſe Men to be Envy'd then? No, <hi>Go into the Sanctuary,</hi> as this Pſalmiſt did, that is, conſult Religion, <hi>and you will underſtand their End, that ſurely they are ſet in ſlippery Places; and that God will caſt them down into Deſtruction,</hi> ver. 17, 18. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fret not thy ſelf, becauſe of Evil-doers, neither be thou Envious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the workers of Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 37.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In caſe of Poverty, in particular, <hi>You muſt be infinitely careful, leaſt to reſcue your ſelf out of it, you be Tempted to Fraud, and eſpecially to Stealing and Purloyning.</hi>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40806:97"/> And it is a Man's Duty indeed, by all honeſt ways, to reſcue himſelf out of ſuch an ill Condition; as by Labour and Induſtry in an honeſt Calling, to Relieve One from Want, and Cold, and Nakedneſs; and to ſuffer any Hardſhips, rather than to run into Debt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Impriſonment. But however, whatever Diſtreſſes you ſhall fall into, you muſt Reſolve with <hi>Job</hi> thus, 27.2, 3.6, 7. <hi>As God liveth, who hath taken away my Judgment, and the Almighty, who hath vexed my Soul; All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my Noſtrils, I will not remove my Integrity from me; My Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I will hold faſt, and will not let it go; my Heart ſhall not Reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi>

Now <hi>Diſgrace</hi> is a thing, which Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is extreamly ſenſible of: And if it be generally a matter of Diſgrace, to profeſs true and ſerious Religion, it is wonderful how Men will ſhrink from it, who in their own Minds have ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of it, and good Affections towards it. It was the fear of this <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> which made <hi>Nicodemus come to our Saviour by Night, Joh.</hi> 7.50. And tho' <hi>Many of the chief Rulers alſo Believed on him, yet, becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, for they lov'd the Praiſe of Men, more than the Praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. that is, They Valued their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with Men, and their Places and Poſts of Honour, more than the Teſtimony of, and Reputation with, God himſelf.</p>
            <p>But as the True Religion is here openly Profeſt amongſt us; and generally it receives no Diſgrace heartily to Eſpouſe it, and to Live up to it; but is indeed a matter of Diſgrace to do the contrary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be with ſome profligate Debauchees of our Age: If it happen that you ſhould Fall into their Company and Acquaintance (which God preſerve you from:) So the Temptations of this Nature, which they will give you, to cool you towards the ſerious Profeſſion, and Practice of Religion, will be Conſider'd hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>wicked World,</hi> and the Temptations, which Ariſe from thence.</p>
            <p>And thus I have conſider'd, and laid before you, as the <hi>World</hi> in General, and the <hi>Good Things</hi> thereof in Particular, viz. <hi>Riches, Honours,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures:</hi> So on the contrary, the Oppoſite Evils of it,

And there is no Man, nor Woman, if not utterly diſabled in Body and Mind, who ought not to be of ſome ſuch Calling: That is,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, every Man ought in a ſettled Courſe of Life to betake himſelf to ſome Buſineſs.<note place="margin">Every Man is to betake himſelf to ſome Buſineſs.</note> 
               <hi>Adam,</hi> even in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was Enjoyn'd to <hi>Dreſs and keep the Garden,</hi> or e're he could <hi>Freely eat of every Tree thereof,</hi> Gen. 2.15, 16. And ſince his Fall, it is as well the Duty, as it is the Curſe of all his Poſterity, that <hi>In the ſweat of our Brows we muſt eat of our Bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. So that every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt now with great Induſtry and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Employ himſelf, in order to obtain the Neceſſaries or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of this Life. It was indeed from the very Beginning, and even in Paradiſe it ſelf, our Duty to be Employ'd; but it is now both our Duty and Puniſhment, that we muſt Employ our ſelves, even to the taking of Pains, every Man in his proper Calling.</p>
            <p>And that Calling, which every Man is to employ his Time in, muſt be ſuch, as Providence has fitted him with Abilities for.<note place="margin">It muſt be ſuch as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has fitted him with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for.</note>

I ſhall only tell you, that the Guilt contracted by theſe is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Great, and a ſufficient Repentance for Crimes ſo very Black, ſo near to impoſſible, that you muſt ſo far Renounce 'em, as to Deteſt the very thoughts of Embarking your ſelves ever in theſe, or any other <hi>Callings,</hi> whereby Sin is immediately and neceſſarily ſerv'd, and the Damnation of thoſe <hi>Souls, for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> ſo directly procur'd.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It concerns all Perſons to Renounce all ſuch Callings, as tend to the Hurt, not the Good of the Publick.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Such as tend to the Hurt, not the Good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note> The Publick Good is the great End of all the divers Callings of Men, as you will ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And conſequently nothing ought to be took up, as a Calling, which <hi>Impoveriſhes,</hi> or <hi>Corrupts the Manners of a People.</hi> And upon this Account therefore I ſhall not doubt to Arraign, and I wiſh the Magiſtrate would Univerſally Condemn, the Calling of ſuch, who keep <hi>Tipling-houſes</hi> meerly to harbour Vagabonds and looſe People; and to draw Men into Riot and Exceſs, to the great Impoveriſhing of many Families, and the Creating of ſcandalous Breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Husbands and their Wives. An Inn-Keeper, whoſe Houſe is well ſituated for the Entertainment of the Traveller, upon his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40806:98"/> lawful Occaſions, is of great uſe in the Commonwealth. And tho' there be more of Temptation in his Calling than moſt others, yet if he takes care to prevent, as much as poſſible, all Swearing and Drunkenneſs within his Doors, all Lewdneſs and Wantonneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Servants; and will do all he can to diſcourage Rioting to unſeaſonable Hours, he will thereby do good Service to God, as well as his Country, by ſuch his Calling, and ſo Conſcientiouſly manag'd. But your meer <hi>Ale-houſe-keeping,</hi> where the whole Trade is to inveigle Perſons into Ill-husbandry, to the Expence of their Time and Money, and with all the Shifts and Contrivances to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 'em, when they are got in, is ſo great a Peſt to this Nation; occaſions ſo much Immorality and Licentiouſneſs; ſo much Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Profaneſs, Lewdneſs and Wantonneſs; ſuch miſerable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty amongſt the lower Rank of Houſe-keepers; ſuch Brawls and Contentions betwixt Husbands and Wives; and yields ſo much Harbour, and gives ſo much Encouragement to Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; that this Calling can hardly be ſuppos'd taken up in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Places, by Vertuous and Honeſt Perſons, but is generally the laſt Reſerve of looſe and idle Livers, who would never endure to Labour in an honeſt Employment. And therefore I would not have you, tho' you ſhould be brought into the ſoreſt Want, and be pincht with extream Neceſſity, ever take up ſo dangerous a Calling: I do ſay very moderately, ſo dangerous a Calling; for at beſt, there is the utmoſt danger of Ruine to your Innocency therein, and no One ſure, who has the leaſt tender Regard for his Soul, will take up ſuch a Calling, where there is but the leaſt Poſſibility left of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping the Loſs thereof. And in this Rank alſo, as extreamly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Religion and Morality, I think I may ſafely place the <hi>Calling of Players.</hi> I know how Touchy many will be on ſuch Perſons account. I ſhall therefore chooſe to expreſs my Opinion, concerning their Calling, in the Words of a very Learn'd, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Biſhop of our own Church; who does acknowledge, That <q>ſhould they be Try'd by the Bench of Fathers, and Councils, of Old; would have it put to moſt Voices amongſt later Divines, both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Reformed, they would be utterly Caſt and Condemn'd; moſt holding, not the Calling only, but the very Practice and Thing it ſelf Unlawful and Damnable:</q> And how Pernicious they are to Religion and Manners, I ſhall have Occaſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſtians muſt Renounce all thoſe wicked Arts, whereby ſome do Abuſe the moſt worthy and uſeful Callings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> All ſinful Arts in the moſt uſeful Callings.</note> 
               <hi>to ſerve their worldly Ends.</hi> And indeed there is no Calling, tho' never ſo good in it ſelf, but has its Temptations attending it, and Perſons of ill Principles and diſhoneſt Minds, will ſadly comply therewith. Thus even in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> the moſt excellent and uſeful Calling in the World, ſince ſuch Multitudes <hi>will not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> and few of the Greater ſort eſpecially, will without the utmoſt Indignation brook a Reproof; many are therefore Tempted to Temper their Doctrines to the Humour of their Party; and others to wink at the moſt ſcandalous Offences and Immoralities, thoſe great Reproaches of Chriſtianity. But if we ſhould be wholly in telling you your <hi>Priviledges in Chriſt,</hi> which the moſt Carnal Minds will love to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40806:99"/> hear of, but little in Inſtructing you in the Duties of Religion, which are ſo neceſſary to the gaining of an Intereſt in him (which ſome ſort of People will call a <hi>Legal Preaching</hi>) we might perhaps thereby make our ſelves Dear to a Party, but we ſhould be Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Chriſt. So again, ſhould we forbear to Reprove the Envy, the Malice, Pride, Cenſoriouſneſs, and Covetouſneſs under the Mask of Religion, of the Hypocrite on the one ſide, or the open and ſcandalous Profaneſs and Debaucheries of the Libertine (who calls himſelf of our Church) on the other, we ſhould be reckon'd amongſt thoſe wicked Prophets <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. who humour'd and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Opinions and Vices of God's People, and muſt expect that heavy Doom pronounc'd againſt ſuch in that Chapter.</p>
            <p>And indeed as every other Calling has its particular Temptations belonging to it: So what is worſe, moſt Men think they may Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly enough comply therewith, and do think it indeed a neceſſary part of their Profeſſion ſo to do. Thus the Lawyer (a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and uſeful Profeſſion in a Commonwealth, as being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Property, and Right, and Peaceableneſs ſhould be maintained amongſt Men) may be Tempted perhaps, to think it a Part of his Profeſſion to encourage Strife, and foment Differences; and that the Malice and Revenge, the Wrath and Bitterneſs; the Slanders and Evil-ſpeakings; the Strife and Contentions, which are other Men's Sins, muſt be his Livelihood: And that he muſt make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Acquainted by Drinking hard, with the worſt ſort of People, that he may gain an Intereſt himſelf in 'em, and get into Buſineſs. So likewiſe the Tradeſman will plead, that the Importunity of Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who will certainly beat down the Price of his Commodities, as low as they can, does make it neceſſary by Proteſtations, and Equivocations, and Lyes, to ſet off his Wares to the beſt advantage. And how few are Country-Dealers, who do not think it neceſſary (or they cannot pay a hard Rent, and maintain a Family) to take advantage of the Ignorance, or Neceſſity of their Neighbours; and not only to conceal the Defects, but by plain downright Lying and Avouching, that their Beaſt is upright and ſound, put it off for more than it is Worth. Thus ſome Men, of all Profeſſions, will think they muſt do, or elſe they cannot Live. And indeed, if Men could not get a Livelihood, but in a way and trade of Sinning, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Callings, and Profeſſions, and Dealers in the World, would<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly under a ſhrewd Temptation.</p>
            <p>But tell me, muſt Men ſell their Souls to the Devil for ever, for the Gains here, we know not how ſoon we muſt leave? We count <hi>Eſau</hi> a fooliſh, as well as profane Perſon, who in Extremity of Hunger, ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Pottage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.33, 34. And what is that Chriſtian, who ſhall ſell his Eternal Inheritance for a Thing, in compariſon, of no Value?</p>
            <p>But I can ſee no neceſſity of foregoing a Livelihood, or of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temptations of a Calling. Indeed, if by a Livelihood Men did not mean living in Superfluity, Vanity, Luxury, which neither God, nor Nature has made neceſſary to any Man's Being, nor indeed Wel-being in the World: If they meant no more than getting an honeſt, and moderate Proviſion, ſuitable to the Station and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Providence has plac'd 'em in, I do not know, but generally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40806:99"/> Men do better provide for themſelves, by plain and honeſt Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than by ſerving their Intereſts, by any ſinful Art, or Cunning whatſoever. I do believe it is a true Proverb, generally ſpeaking, that <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy;</hi> and Men Thrive, tho' but ſlowly by it, yet better and ſurer than by Cheating and Over-reaching. And it is almoſt every One's Obſervation, That a little Subſtance honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got is a Comfort to the Owners, whilſt the Eſtate that is ill got waſts like Butter in the Sun, and derives down a Curſe upon thoſe on whom it deſcends.</p>
            <p>But however, tho' it be not ſo, that Honeſty is the beſt way to Thrive, and tho' your Temptations ſhould be never ſo great, and your Wants never ſo preſſing, you muſt ſuffer that Want, or ſuffer worſe. And you would do well to conſider, that thoſe who will rather ſuffer Want here, than by ſinful Ways provide a Relief, ſhall be ſure not to want the Love, and Mercies of God hereafter, and that will abundantly Recompence for all defect of Advantages in this World.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You muſt Renounce all Levity, and Deſultory Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from one Calling to another.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> All Levity and Deſulto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Skipping from one Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> This may ſeem rather a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, than Religious Precept, becauſe in common Obſervation it is ſeldom ſeen, that the Man of ſeveral Trades and Callings does Thrive, and that the <hi>Rolling Stone</hi> never gathers <hi>Moſs.</hi> But it is an Inſtruction, which is alſo of a Religious Importance, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Every Man is</hi> commanded <hi>to Abide in the ſame Calling, wherein he was called.</hi> And tho' it may be Lawful to lay down One, and to <q>take up another Profeſſion, or Trade, when either abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity enforceth it, or lawful Authority enjoineth it; or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of weighty Circumſtances faithfully, and diſcreetly, and ſoberly laid together, ſeemeth to require it; as the Judicious Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> Stateth this Caſe: Yet this muſt be done, as he ſays, with all due Caution; as Firſt, not out of Lightneſs, and Unſettledneſs; nor Secondly, out of the Greedineſs of a Covetous, or Ambitious Luſt; nor Thirdly, out of Sullenneſs, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs at our preſent Condition; nor Laſtly, out of Envy againſt our Neighbour, that liveth by us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, that Change of Callings is to be Renounced, as the higheſt Profaneneſs, when Laymen and Tradeſmen, nay, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (as amongſt the Quakers, ſo expreſly contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34.) do Sacrilegiouſly uſurp the ſacred Office of the Miniſtry, and ſet up for Teachers without a lawful Call, or Ordination thereunto. Nor is there any Force in what they'll pretend, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. where it is ſaid of all Chriſtians in general, <hi>That Chriſt hath made them Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father;</hi> for the ſame is ſpoke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.6. of the whole Jewiſh Nation, that <hi>They ſhould be a Kingdom of Prieſts, and an holy Nation.</hi> And yet we find that the Prieſthood was ſo much a ſeparated Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſo dangerous to be Uſurpt, that <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company paid dearly for Attempting it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. as alſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> as you will ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of that high Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. wherein Chriſtians in general are call'd Prieſts, is the ſame as in <hi>Exod.</hi> For as the whole Jewiſh Nation were there ſtyl'd a <hi>Kingdom of Prieſts, and a holy Nation,</hi> with reſpect to the Pagan
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40806:100"/> World, from whom they were to be as much ſeparated by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Holineſs, as the Prieſthood amongſt 'em was from the People. So we Chriſtians, ſuch is our Holy Calling, are to be as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and diſtinguiſht from Jews and Gentiles both, by our Holy Living, as the Goſpel Miniſtry are by a ſacred Character, from the reſt of Chriſtian People.</p>
            <p>No certainly, all thoſe of the Laity, who uſurp the Office of the Miniſtry ſhould learn Sobriety, and to keep themſelves within the proper Bounds and Limits of their Callings, conſidering that equally now, as in the Jewiſh Church, <hi>The Prieſt's lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and that they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Any, Calling whatſoever is to be declin'd for which a Perſon is not Qualified, both by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Inclinations.</note>Fifthly, And that you may not lightly, and with a worſe Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that of Inconſtancy, change your Calling; <hi>Decline that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whatever, how Creditable, or how Profitable ſoever it be, for which you are not Qualify'd both by Education, Abilities, and Inclination.</hi> The great Fault in this reſpect is commonly the Parents, who <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> as it were, their Children to ſuch Callings, as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without conſulting thoſe other Requiſites now named, to make them Excellent and Uſeful to themſelves, or others therein; and this is the reaſon, that ſo many miſ-carry in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to their own Ruine and Diſgrace, and the Diſappointment and Damage of others in the Buſineſs they undertake.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eſpecially Callings of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch as the Miniſtry.</note>And according, as is the Importance of any Calling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly does it the more concern Perſons, both for their own ſakes, and the World's, that they decline ſuch as they are not fitted for by a <hi>ſuitable Education,</hi> by <hi>competent Abilities,</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> and by a <hi>ſtrong Inclination thereunto.</hi> Now the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is a Calling of the vaſteſt Conſequence in the World, even the Salvation of many Souls, depending upon a Man's being duly Qualify'd thereto. There ought in the firſt place to be a ſuitable Education, in thoſe <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> given to ſuch as are Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for it, that they may be prepar'd thereto by the Knowledge of thoſe learn'd Languages, wherein the Inſpir'd Writers did Pen the Holy Scriptures, and by many other Arts and Sciences, which are Hand-maids to Divinity, and can there only be ſufficiently attain'd to. There ought next to be great Abilities and Gifts, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts, and Divine Graces, and a good ſhare of all ſorts of Learning acquir'd by much Study, and great Induſtry, to make an uſeful Divine; there being no one Profeſſion in the World, which requires to its Perfection, ſuch an univerſal Knowledge, as <hi>Theology</hi> does. And to all theſe there muſt be added ſtrong <hi>Inclinations</hi> to the Holy Office; <hi>Inclinations</hi> to it, not upon the account of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and Dignities that attend it, but for the Works ſake; <hi>Inclinations</hi> indeed to be an Inſtrument of God's Glory, and of the Salvation of Men's Souls therein. And now, if a Perſon of no good Abilities, or Gifts ſhould be <hi>determin'd</hi> to the Miniſtry, it is a Sacrilegious Profaneneſs of equal Guilt, as it is Impiety in ſome Parents, who think ſuch of the moſt promiſing Parts amongſt their Children, an Offering too good for the Lord. Or if a Perſon of a ſuitable <hi>Education,</hi> and of great Abilities, that fit him for it, ſhould enter into it with an unwilling Mind, is often too great
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40806:100"/> a ſign of unſanctify'd Affections, that would be for greater Liberty and Gaiety, than the Gravity and Seriouſneſs of his Profeſſion will allow him; and the Fop ſhould be counted unworthy of it. Or laſtly, if there be never ſo ſtrong Inclinations to be a Teacher, without the Preparations of an Univerſity Education, and learned Abilities, as well as Divine Graces, it ſhews the Perſon to be One of thoſe, who <hi>Deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtood neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.7.</p>
            <p>And indeed in any Calling whatſoever, there muſt be a joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of every one of theſe fore-mention'd Qualifications; for if any one of 'em be wanting, that Perſon will be unſucceſsful in his Calling; inſomuch that if there be never ſo ſuitable an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Abilities, if there be wanting that one other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of ſtrong Inclinations to ſuch a Courſe of Life, the Buſineſs of it will be carried on with <hi>Sloth and Negligence,</hi> which is the</p>
            <p>Sixth <hi>Thing, that muſt be Renounced, as to any Calling.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Idleneſs in any Calling is to be renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Idleneſs has the ſame Effect in any other Calling, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerv'd it had in the Husband-man's, concerning whom he tells us, <hi>That going by the Field of the Slothful, and by the Vineyard of the man void of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, lo it was all grown over with Thorns, and Nettles had covered the face thereof,</hi> Prov. 24.30, 31. Thereby the Underſtanding of the Scholar is over-ſpread with Ignorance; the Manners of the Gentleman with Barbarity and Savageneſs; and Poverty and Nakedneſs do enter, through Sloth, the Houſes of Tradeſmen. But on the other ſide, how comfortable are the Fruits of Induſtry, either in Man, or Woman? Particularly as to the Woman's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, there is ſuch an Account given thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. from the 10 <hi>ver.</hi> to the End of that <hi>Chap.</hi> as ſhews the mighty Happineſs to Husband, Children, and Servants, where ſuch a One is the Miſtreſs of the Family; and her Character ought to begot by Heart, by every Perſon of her Sex. And therefore the Effects of Sloth being ſo diſmal and miſerable; but the Fruits of Induſtry ſo very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and comfortable, according as the Wiſe-man adviſes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but it is enough you'll ſay, for thoſe to be Induſtrious,<note place="margin">Idleneſs not allowable, no not in Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> who are to <hi>Live by their Calling:</hi> But as for ſuch, who enjoy a ſufficiency and plenty of the Neceſſaries, Conveniencies and Superfluities of this World; what occaſion is there that they ſhould be Induſtrious: For as it is commonly ſaid, <hi>What is a Gentleman, but his Pleaſures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But give me leave to Anſwer in the words of an excellent Perſon, that if this be true, <q>If a Gentleman be nothing elſe but this, then truly he is a ſad Piece, the moſt inconſiderable, the moſt deſpicable, the moſt pitiful and wretched Creature in the World.</q> If it be his Priviledge to do nothing, then it is his Priviledge to be Good for nothing, to be a meer Weight and Burthen upon the Earth; nay the Peſt and Plague of Mankind, ſince the Soul of Man is that active Power, that if it does not actuate and employ a Man in doing Good, it will certainly in doing Miſchief: So that to ſay thus of the Gentleman, or Man of Fortunes, is highly to Reproach him. But the Contrary is moſt certain.</p>
            <p>And no Man, be he in never ſo flouriſhing a State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, muſt give himſelf up to Idleneſs, as being One of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40806:101"/> greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin, and in it ſelf a Life very diſpleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It is one of the greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin.</note>
               <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> I ſay, <hi>is one of the greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin.</hi> So great a Temptation indeed it is, that the idle Perſon <hi>Tempts</hi> the Devil to come and Tempt him. That wicked Spirit <hi>Continually walketh about the Earth, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> and ſpying a Perſon to be Idle, he infallibly lies down before him. He muſters up all his Forces to beleaguer that Man, ſends for the like idle and licentious Perſons as himſelf, and thoſe with all poſſible Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements inveigle him to join with 'em in their wicked Courſes. And his Mind being taken up with no honeſt Cares, the Devil throws into his Soul a Thouſand ill Thoughts, and baſe Deſigns, and lewd Imaginations to corrupt him, and make him yield. And the greateſt of Men and Saints, have been Overcome meerly by being found Idle, as we have an eminent Inſtance in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.2. <hi>Who walking on the roof of his Houſe,</hi> his Mind then roving, and being untackt from honeſt Cares, that Temptation ſeiz'd on him, whereby he was plung'd into that woful Miſcarriage, in the Matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> which did create him ſo much Sorrow, did make ſuch a Spot in his Life, as was never waſht off, no not with his Tears of Repentance: So excellent was the Advice of the Father; <hi>Be always doing ſomething, that the Devil may never find thee Idle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And is it ſelf a very great Sin.</note>Nor is the Idleneſs of Perſons in a plentiful and flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>in it ſelf leſs a Sin,</hi> than it is a Temptation to other Sins. Theſe are the Perſons, who have Talents given 'em, and their Idleneſs is expreſt by <hi>Hiding their Talents in the Earth,</hi> Mat. 25.25. which how great a Sin it is, is evident from our Saviour's ſevere Menaces thereupon, calling ſuch an idle Perſon a <hi>Wicked and ſlothful Servant, and commanding him to be caſt,</hi> becauſe an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant, <hi>into outer darkneſs, where ſhould be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> ver. 30. It is remarkable, that here the wicked Servant is ſo ſeverely Doom'd, not for miſ-employing, but for being Idle, and not employing his Talent: So that no Man's Condition, be it never ſo Plentiful, will excuſe him in Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt Thing to be Renounced, with reference to a Calling, is the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, no Man muſt live above his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> This is what the Vanity and Pride of many, both Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Tradeſmen, and others, do Tempt 'em to; but the Iſſue thereof is in a ſhort time to be Needy and Borrowing, and conſequently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and to meet with Scorn inſtead of that Reſpect they ſeek, by making an outward Appearance and Flouriſh. But the worſt of it is, when Men are of this Humour, to live above their Calling, in order to maintain their Port and Pride, they are forc'd, if Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to oppreſs their Tenants; if Tradeſmen to cheat and over-reach their Cuſtomers, and to uſe all the evil Arts of Getting. And as to the latter, when they ſo far ſcorn the Meanneſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as to throw it aſide, it is not ſeldom, that in the End they take to the High-way, as the only Means of maintaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In ſhort therefore to prevent the fatal Effects of both theſe laſt Evils, Idleneſs, and living beyond a Man's Calling, my Advice to young Perſons is to be Induſtrious, till ſuch time at leaſt, as they have laid up a Stock, whereby they may afford to live more at Eaſe, and not to throw off the meaneſt Calling, till they are able to live
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40806:101"/> Creditably without it. And ſo much for the Callings of the World, and what is to be Renounced with Relation to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us conſider amongſt thoſe Things of the World of a middle Nature, the different Conditions and States of Men therein.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Amongſt thoſe things of the World of a middle Nature, the the different Conditions and States of Men therein are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</note> And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part are in the State, either of <hi>Maſters,</hi> or of <hi>Servants.</hi> And the whole World are either <hi>Single,</hi> or <hi>Married Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Firſt, as to the State and Condition of a Maſter, there are very great Advantages and Opportunities, which the Head of a Family has of doing Good amongſt thoſe of his Houſhold; inſomuch that if he keep up an orderly and religious Diſcipline in his Family, it will be no hard matter for him, ſo to form the Principles and Practices of his Servants and Dependants, as to be able to undertake with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> 24.15. that he, and his Houſe, ſhall ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>But yet this, as all other Conditions of Men in this World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> A Maſter has great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of doing Good.</note> is liable to be Abuſed to great degrees of Diſhonour to God, and Injury to the Souls of Men, as namely when thoſe, who are Maſters do ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their Commands, as to give no leiſure to their Servants to provide for the Good of their own Souls.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a Dominion as this muſt be utterly Renounced, and it ſhould be a Thing never heard of amongſt Chriſtians, that a Servant ſhould be ſuch a Slave, as to be treated no better than a Brute:<note place="margin">But all that Dominion is to be utterly Renounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which treats Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Slaves and Brutes.</note> And as Paſture is the only thing provided for the latter, ſo bodily Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be the only thing took care of for the former. No, every one that will expect <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bleſſing and Favour with God, muſt have <hi>Abraham</hi>'s pious Care of the religious Education and Government both of his Children and Servants; concerning whom it is Recorded, that God did Impart unto him a very great ſecret, under the Notion of a ſingular Favour, upon this very Account, That <hi>He knew he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children, and his Houſhold after him, that they ſhould keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment,</hi> Gen. 18.19. So that when any of you ſhall grow up, or arrive to that Condition, to be the Heads of a Family, this muſt be alſo your Care, and you muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Renounce the Treating your Servants at that Diſtance, as if they were not Fellow-ſervants with you to the ſame God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The next Condition, or State of Life in this World to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd of, is that of Servants.</hi> Now a Servant amongſt Chriſtians, if he be not Barbarouſly and Un-chriſtianly us'd, is not the moſt unhappy State:<note place="margin">The State of Servants not in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</note> Tho' he has not his Maſter's Liberty, yet if he has leſs of his Licentiouſneſs, he is the happier Man. But yet if it falls out ſo, that the Maſter and Family, he happens into, be Diſorderly, Debauched, and Wicked, he is in a State of mighty Temptation, and in great danger of being Corrupted: And therefore</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It concerns every Perſon, who is to live by a Service,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> It concerns every Perſon, who is to live by a Service, to avoid ſuch where there is neither the means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon Sin.</note> 
               <hi>to Renounce and Refuſe thoſe</hi> (if extream Neceſſity, and want of Better, do not compel him to Accept of ſuch) <hi>where a great deal of Wickedneſs is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed without Controul, and little of the Fear of God is to be ſeen amongſt Maſters, or Servants.</hi> We do daily pray to God, <hi>Not to lead us into Temptation,</hi> and thoſe who are ſincere in their Prayers, will not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily throw themſelves into ſuch a dangerous place of Temptation, as is a wicked Family; where not only the ordinary Means of Grace, the reading of the word of God, and daily Prayers are wanting: But the Examples of both Head and Members do influence to an Imitation in Lewdneſs, Drunkenneſs, Injuſtice, Curſing, Swearing, and all Impiety;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40806:102"/> and where Profaneneſs does ſo far prevail, as to inſtigate 'em to break their Jeſts upon Religion and Vertue. Alas! it is a very difficult thing for Youth to be throughly ſeaſon'd with Principles of Vertue, even by all the Inſtruction and Care of Miniſters, Parents, and Maſters. How then muſt it be next to a Miracle, if they fly not out into all manner of Licentiouſneſs, when the Corruption within is heighten'd with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Encouragements of all about 'em, and thoſe too, Perſons upon whoſe Favour they depend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But ſince Idleneſs and want of Employment does expoſe a Perſon to Temptation, even more than ſuch Services; and if Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhall force you into thoſe, where little of ſpiritual Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but all manner of Temptations to Sin, is to be expected: why then with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> Gen. 39.8. you muſt put on the moſt ſtedfaſt Reſolutions to preſerve your Innocence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> In the moſt Irreligious Families a Servant ſhall happen into, he muſt put on a ſtedfaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</note> and muſt <hi>make a Covenant with your Eyes,</hi> Ears, and all your Senſes, that they do not <hi>Offend.</hi> And when Divine Providence has diſpos'd you there, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace will not be wanting to your own honeſt Endeavours, to preſerve you from Evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The next State, and that wherein the greateſt part of Mankind in this World are found, is the State of Celibacy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The State of Celibacy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to Devotion, &amp; in Times of Diſtreſs.</note> or the ſingle Life; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking to thoſe which are Unmarried, tells 'em, <hi>It is Good for them if they Abide ſo,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.8. and that upon Two Accounts: Firſt at all Times, becauſe of the greater Freedom and Vacancy for Meditation, and Divine Employments therein; <hi>He that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried careth for the Things of the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord:</hi> Secondly, and more eſpecially in Times of Perſecution, or the Approach of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings coming upon the Church of God, and becauſe of the preſent, or impendent Diſtreſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. But yet this State is the moſt ſubject to Unchaſt Deſires, and Lewd Practices, if not powerfully reſtrain'd by rooted Principles of Vertue. And therefore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Even the State of Celibacy it ſelf muſt be Renounc'd and Forſaken, by thoſe who cannot contain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This muſt be renounced, when Perſons cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> according to the Advice of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. <hi>They who cannot contain let them Marry, for it is better to Marry than to Burn:</hi> For alas! when Perſons Morals are once Corrupted in this Kind, it is very rare, that either Man, or Woman, returns to that juſt Abomination and Abhorrence, which all Chriſtians ought to have of the very Thoughts and Expreſſions of Uncleanneſs, according to that of St. <hi>Paul: But Fornication, and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, let it not be once Named amongſt you, as becometh Saints; Neither Filthineſs, nor Fooliſh Talking, nor Jeſtings, which are not convenient,</hi> Eph. 5.3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, the Marry'd ſtate has its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</note>The laſt State of Perſons I ſhall here mention, is that of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, a State Ordain'd by God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.4. and the more to be lik'd, that beſides the mutual Supports and Comforts afforded to each other therein, many, both Husbands and Wives, do owe their Converſion to Chriſtianity; and from a wicked, to a good Life, to the prudent and diſcreet Inſtruction of one, or other, of the Married Couple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16. Nevertheleſs there is Danger in this, as well as in other States. In Times of Diſtreſs, they are apt to be Tempters to one another, to ſinful Compliances; and at all times are Plung'd into worldly Cares, and <hi>He that is Married careth for the Things, that are of the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.33. and that too often to the great Hindrance of Religion.

            <p>Secondly, And even in the Married State, all thoſe worldly Cares, which choak up, or diſturb Religion, muſt be utterly laid aſide, as will be fully ſhew'd you under the Next, and</p>
            <p>Laſt of thoſe Things pertaining to this World, which afford great matter of Temptation to us, <hi>viz. The Cares thereof.</hi> Now as to the Cares of this World, true it is, we have many worldly Intereſts and Engagements to mind, we have the Neceſſities, both of our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of thoſe who belong to us, to ſerve.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> And Engage too much in worldly Cares</note> Nor is any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for us without Induſtry and Endeavour; ſo that by the Neceſſity of our Condition we are, every One of us, more or leſs, ſome in one way, ſome in another, engag'd in worldly Affairs. Hence it is,<note place="margin">Laſtly, the Cares of this World, the laſt of thoſe Things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that ſome Care about the Things of this World is allow'd us; nay, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are commanded <hi>to continue in the Calling, wherein God hath ſet us,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20. and we are warn'd, that <hi>we be not ſlothful in Buſineſs,</hi> Rom. 12.11.</p>
            <p>But the great Unhappineſs and Sin of many in this difficult caſe, is this; That a moderate Concern for the Things of this World being Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, they are apt to Overwhelm themſelves in a multiplicity of Cares: As alſo to let the Cares of this world to Alienate their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from God, and Heavenly Things; and to withdraw their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from him, in thoſe Divine Services, they are bound to Pay him. And few, who are far engag'd in Temporal Deſigns and Cares, know when to Retire from the world, and to throw them off; ſo as to give themſelves a ſufficient Time to prepare for a better Life. But as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as worldly Cares, are in moſt men's Circumſtances; yet</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It becomes Chriſtians to Renounce that Multiplicity of Cares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> It becomes Chriſtians to renounce a multiplicity of Cares.</note> 
               <hi>which diſtracts their Thoughts, and ſhews 'em to have no other Aims, but at this World.</hi> And yet ſo it is, that ſome Men fill their Heads with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Projects, and do ſo Overwhelm themſelves with Variety of Buſineſs, that they do ſcarcely allow themſelves time to Eat and Sleep. But to be in a perpetual Hurry after this World's Goods, and to be ſo over-ſolicitous for our future Proviſion in it, is an Argument of Men's Diſcontent with that Condition, wherein Providence has plac'd 'em; and of an anxious Fear, they ſhall not be ſufficiently Provided for by God's Bleſſing, concurring with an honeſt Induſtry in their Affairs: And is ſuch a Care, as however it might become Pagans, who knew little of the Doctrine of God's Providence in this Life, and of his Treaſures of Bliſs, provided for us in another; Yet is infinitely unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chriſtians, who are throughly Inſtructed in the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Care over us, and his future Proviſions for us; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſtrictly forbid us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. from the 24th Verſe, to the End.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It behoves us Chriſtians ſo far to Renounce any Worldly Care, as it does Alienate our Affections from God, and Heavenly Things;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Every world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Care, ſo far as it does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate our Affections from God, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things.</note> 
               <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Attention from him, in the Services we are bound to Pay him,</hi> as is too often. I ſay, as is too often. For hence it is, that ſo many do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Holy Duties, both Publick and Private, and that they Perform either with ſo little Devotion. Hence it is, that many come ſo ſeldom to Church; or when they do, that they carry themſelves in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Prayer, Praiſes, and at the Hearing of the Word, with ſo much Coldneſs, Lazineſs, and want of Attention. And hence alſo it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40806:103"/> is, that at Home there is ſo ſeldom any Family-Prayers, and Reading of the Scriptures, and good Books. And I wiſh, <hi>That riſing up early, and ſitting up late, and eating the Bread of Carefulneſs,</hi> may not hinder ſome from Paying any Devotion to God, as much as Privately by themſelves, every Morning and Evening. And y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t this is the leaſt that can be imply'd in thoſe Precepts of <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Men ought always to Pray,</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. where we are enjoin'd to <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> And to be Negligent, or Inattentive, through the Incumbrance of worldly Cares, at the Hearing of the Word, was the thing for which our Saviour Reprov'd <hi>Martha,</hi> who was <hi>Cumbring her ſelf with much Serving,</hi> when ſhe ought to have Liſten'd to our Saviour's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, for which He Commended her, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. And therefore it behoves every Chriſtian, when he enters into the Houſe of God, or into his own Cloſet, wholly to lay aſide all worldly Cares for that Time, and to ſay to 'em, as Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Stay you here, whilſt go and Pray yonder.</hi>

Now as to our ſelves, the nearer Life draws to an End, the leſs of temporal Proviſions are neceſſary. And as to Poſterity, the beſt Proviſion that can be made for them, is what may be enough to be a Foundation for their Induſtry, and not ſo much as will diſ-engage 'em from Buſineſs and Employment; for to leave 'em great Eſtates, is but to expoſe 'em to the Temptations of Idleneſs, Luxury, and the worſt of Sins: To which, as all Men in great Poſſeſſions are liable, ſo none more than ſuch, who have been ſuddenly rais'd by the Covetouſneſs of a worldly Miſer. As therefore thoſe Men of Buſineſs, who would be counted the only Wiſe, will not ſhew themſelves in the End the greateſt Fools, when they have Advanc'd far in Years, at leaſt-wiſe, they ſhould look upon that Advice of the Prophet, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed to them, <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt ſurely dye, and not live:</hi> Such Men have receiv'd more Talents than others, and therefore they ought to take more time to State their Accompts, that they may come off at the Great Audit, with the Approbation of having been good and faithful Servants.</p>

               <hi>THE Seventeenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
            <p>THE Point that we are now upon, being to lay before you the Strength of thoſe Temptations, which do ariſe, Firſt, <hi>From the World,</hi> Secondly, <hi>From the wicked World,</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>From the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World:</hi> And as to the Firſt, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Having ſufficiently diſcover'd what Temptations to Sin we ſhall meet with, both from the <hi>World in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and the <hi>ſeveral Things</hi> therein contain'd, in <hi>Particular,</hi> I come now,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To give you a Survey likewiſe too of the wicked World, and to ſhew you alſo in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce the wicked World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> What's meant by the wicked World, and how far, and in what ſence we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.</note> And by the wicked World can be properly meant no other than <hi>wicked Men,</hi> there being no Creature on Earth, beſides Man, that is capable of doing any thing morally Good, or Evil, ſo as to be ſtyl'd from the latter, <hi>Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you would be farther ſatisfy'd, who theſe are, who may be ſo ſtyl'd; it ſeems to me, that it is not every Sinner however,<note place="margin">Thereby is meant ſuch as make it their Buſineſs, like that wicked One, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to Tempt others to Sin.</note> that either in the Language of the Scripture, or in common Account, is call'd a <hi>wicked Man:</hi> But it muſt be ſome One of a more than ordinary Impiety, ſo as to approach ſomething near Satan himſelf in Sin and Wickedneſs, that can deſerve ſo Black a Character. Now the Devil is often term'd in Scripture <hi>The wicked One;</hi> and particularly <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. he is ſo ſtyl'd on the account of his Tempting others to Sin. <hi>His catching away the Word which is ſown in Men's Hearts,</hi> or his Injecting of vain Thoughts into the Minds of the Hearers, that they may not be Converted by the Preaching of the Goſpel: (one of his ways of Tempting us to Sin, as was before ſhew'd) It is this that gave him that Character of the <hi>wicked One.</hi> And on the very ſame account of his Tempting the World to Sin, is his great Agent, <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi> call'd alſo, 2 Theſ. 2.8. <hi>That wicked One.</hi> He is term'd in the 4 <hi>ver. He that oppoſeth God,</hi> and here in this 8 <hi>ver.</hi> he is ſtyl'd <hi>The wicked One,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Coming after the working of Satan with all deceivableneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. that is, becauſe he imitates the Devil by his cunning Tempting of others into Sin, and by deceiving 'em into Unrighteous, Irreligious Courſes, he is therefore call'd the wicked One. And upon the ſame account therefore, as thoſe only are properly wicked Men, who are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40806:104"/> guilty of ſome notorious Crime themſelves; ſo eſpecially ſuch, who make it any part of their Buſineſs to <hi>Corrupt and Tempt</hi> others to Sin, are the wicked Men of the World.</p>
            <p>And according to thoſe Degrees of Tempting, of which Men are guilty, are they to be eſteemed more, or leſs <hi>Wicked, and Diabolically ſo.</hi> Some Men's Temptations are leſs <hi>Extenſive,</hi> and reach no farther than the Neighbourhood, where they are known, and the Company they converſe with. But others there are, whoſe Temptations may reach even unto the utmoſt Parts of the Earth; ſuch are thoſe, who propagate and promote by their Writings, or Diſcourſes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical and Heretical Principles: And ſuch are moſt of our Modern Writers of Play-Books, and Songs, whoſe Plays and Poetry ſeem deſign'd to nouriſh Profaneneſs and Immorality. Now ſuch Temptations as theſe will extend to all Parts, where things of that Nature ſhall reach, and will be Temptations in all Ages, ſo long as there will be found wicked Men like themſelves, to propagate and promote the ſame. The former ſort may be compar'd to an Inferior Rank of Evil Spirits, whoſe Province of doing Miſchief is more narrow and confin'd: But the latter are, as it were, Maſter Devils; <hi>Like roaring Lions, they are continually walking about the Earth, ſeeking whom they may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you muſt heartily Renounce, and Refuſe to Conform your ſelves to thoſe wicked Men, either Firſt, <hi>By becoming Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters your ſelves of other People:</hi> Or, Secondly, <hi>By yielding of your ſelves to be overcome by others Temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>You muſt renounce that Diabolical Wickedneſs of becoming Tempters your ſelves of other Perſons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Diabolical Wickedneſs of becoming Tempters our ſelves of other Perſons.</note> 
               <hi>Renounce,</hi> do I ſay? You muſt Abhor, Abominate, and Deteſt this their Wickedneſs of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting others, and of Tempting 'em to Sin, as being a Practice, that of all others will render you likeſt to the Devil. And I am ſure you would of all things in the World deteſt this Piece of Villany, if you would but attentively conſider that One remarkable place of Scripture, ſhewing you the high Impiety of ſuch a Wickedneſs. It is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. <hi>Elymas the Sorcerer withſtood Barnabas and Paul, ſeeking to turn away the Deputy from the Faith: Then Paul filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſet his Eyes on him, and ſaid, O full of Subtilty and all Miſchief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert rhe right ways of the Lord?</hi> Do you ſee here with what unuſual Indignation, and in what ſevere Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Apoſtle does beſpeak this Wretch, meerly upon his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>Tempt the Deputy from the right way of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely not without Reaſon; for certainly it muſt be a terrible Conſideration to any One, that he has been the Inſtrument and Cauſe of another's Damnation.<note place="margin">It is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to have been an Inſtrument of another's Damnation.</note> For ſhould ſuch a One ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after return to a right Mind (and he will be infinitely miſerable, if he does not) as his Repentance, if it be ſincere, will make him a Lover, not only of his own, but of other men's Souls: So what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh will it give him, to think, that 'tis to be fear'd, there are now thoſe in Hell Flames, whom his ill Example, or vicious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or baſe and corrupting Flatteries in wicked Courſes, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Vertue, or Encouragements to Sin, have ſent there, never to be Retriev'd.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:40806:104"/>
            <p>It is an Injury to men's Souls, in ſome Caſes hardly ever, in other simpoſſible to be Repair'd.<note place="margin">It is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Mens Souls, in ſome Caſes hardly ever, in others impoſſible to be Repair'd.</note> If his Temptations have been of that ſort, as to reach no farther than he was Known, or was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, a very Eminent, and very ſignal Repentance may, in ſome meaſure, put a ſtop to the Contagion thereof; ſo that they ſpread no farther (tho' not that altogether, for ſome perhaps, whom he has Corrupted, will never be Reclaim'd, tho' he be never ſo great a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Labour himſelf never ſo much their Converſion:) But if his Temptations have been of that more ſpreading and laſting Kind, now ſpoke, and he has been One, that has <hi>Wrote Ill Books,</hi> been a <hi>Broacher of Peſtilent Hereſies,</hi> an <hi>Author of lewd Plays, or wanton and prophane Verſe,</hi> the Miſchief and Poyſon of ſuch Temptations do fly beyond his Recalling; and tho' he may Burn 'em with his own Hands, yet others will Rake 'em out of the Aſhes. And it is the Opinion of ſome of the Ancients, that ſuch Temptations as theſe, will affect his Happineſs even in Heaven it ſelf; inſomuch that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Miſchief thereof does daily ſpread, and more do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be Damn'd thereby, proportionably ſuch a One will ſtill fall thereupon lower, and lower in Glory. I know nothing in Reaſon, or Religion, that contradicts this Opinion. However it be, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the higheſt Misfortune can befal any One, that he is, or ever has been amongſt that Rank of Sinners, whom the Scripture does ſo peculiarly Stile the <hi>wicked,</hi> and that becauſe of their ſo near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Tempter himſelf. Theſe are the Perſons <hi>by whom Offences come,</hi> and it is a terrible Threatning, that of our Saviour's, Matth. 18.6. to ſuch, <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones, which believe in me,</hi> that is, any-wiſe Tempt, Gall, Diſcourage, drive from the Faith and Practice of a Chriſtian, any the meaneſt Perſon that comes to me; whoſo ſhall do this, <hi>It were better for him, that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his Neck, and he were caſt into the midſt of the Sea:</hi> So that of all things in the World, it concerns you, to take care, ye never become Tempters of others to Sin, and either to omit that, which is Good, or to commit that, which is Evil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor does it leſs concern you to refuſe Conforming your ſelves to wicked Men, when they ſhall Tempt you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, when they ſhall Tempt us, <hi>viz.</hi>

And I will ſhew you, how by all Means you muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, or Refuſe to Conform your ſelves unto their evil Ways, in any of theſe Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>That you muſt renounce, or refuſe to Conform your ſelves to the evil Examples</hi>

               <hi>of wicked Men, which would Influence you to Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been ever obſerv'd, that Examples have a much greater Influence<note place="margin">Examples have the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon us; eſpecially</note> than Precepts, and that moſt are readier to do what they ſee, than what they hear. More particularly, there is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in us to follow the Examples of Sin; eſpecially if many, if the Examples of thoſe, for whom we have an high Eſteem, and of whom we do ſtand in great Awe.</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:40806:105"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>We are eſpecially inclin'd to follow the Examples of Sin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> If Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sin.</note> For Sin is what our Corrupt Nature is of it ſelf diſpos'd to; and if moreover Examples do come in to help us forward, theſe will highten our Deſires, and ſilence our Conſciences, and give us ſome plauſible Pretence to Sin. It looks like ſome Act of Modeſty, and Self-denial, to deny our own private Judgment, and to go along with the Croud; when our Fleſh is craving, and our Luſts are up, it is a ſtrange En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to us to Sin in Company, and fulfil 'em. This heartens us againſt our Fears, and abates the Dread of Puniſhment, which would follow the Satisfaction of our Luſts. Now if we are Puniſht for 'em, it will not be we alone, and it is a Comfort to have Fellows in Miſeries, and a Man dares both do, and ſuffer many things in Company, which he would have been diſ-hearten'd to have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on ſingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> Secondly, <hi>We are ſtill more hearten'd to Sin, if the Examples thereof are Common, and Many.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> If common, and many.</note> For why? Beſides that there is a great deal of Proneneſs and Propenſion in all our Natures to Vice and Wickedneſs, the only Reſtraint upon our Inclinations, that we break not out ſuddenly into all Exorbitancy of Ungodlineſs, is as inwardly from the Innate Turpitude and Baſeneſs of Sin: So outwardly from the burning and ſhining Lights, and glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Vertue, that are abroad in the World. Now our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe of the Filthineſs of Sin ſoon ceaſes, when we ſee it Practic'd by the moſt, and thoſe as ſhrew'd, and as wiſe Perſons as our ſelves; and from without, there can be no Upbraiding and ill Report, in giving ſwing to our naughty Deſires, if Vice has once got its Multitudes of Followers, and the Generality of Men of its ſide.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>But farther yet, Examples of Sin are very Contagious, if they are the Examples of ſuch, for whom we have a great Eſteem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> If of ſuch, for whom we have a great Eſteem.</note> Perſons of all Sects and Parties in Religion fix upon ſome in their own way, as very excellent Perſons, and exact Patterns, fit to be imitated in all they do, (as if Men were not Men ſtill, and the Beſt were not ſubject to Miſtake and Failing) whatever Duty of Chriſtianity theſe Men, whom they particularly Admire, ſeem to have but a ſmall regard to, they do not think it at all neceſſary, becauſe ſuch a Good Man, would not, if it were, be wanting in it, they think. And ſo as to any ſinful Practice on the other ſide: Why ſhould I ſcruple to do ſo and ſo, thou wilt ſay, when ſuch a One, and I am ſure he underſtands what he does, ſticks not to do the like. He is a wiſe Man, a good Man, nay, and a Scholar, and yet does ſo and ſo, nor does he fear going to Heaven for all that.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>But above all, the Examples of Sin are the moſt prevalent, when they are backt with the Authority of thoſe, whom we ſtand in awe of.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> If of thoſe of whom we ſtand in awe.</note> Theſe are the Men who will expect, not only to be Obey'd, but Honour'd. And if we Ape and Imitate 'em in all their ways, we may hope thereby to obtain their Favour. If we ſhew a diſlike of their Courſes, we may have reaſon to fear their Diſpleaſure. And what is it that two ſuch active Springs in our Nature, as our <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> are, will not force us to, or drive us from? So powerful you ſee are the Examples of Sin, when they are backt with all theſe Advantages.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:40806:105"/>
            <p>And now the Examples of Sin have all theſe Advantages in 'em, to influence you to Conform your ſelves unto 'em. Ever ſince the unhappy Fall of Man, there is in every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> a great deal of Proneneſs to Sin, rather than to Vertue. Alas! We carry a Principle about us, which is not only buiſy and ready to cloſe with the Temptations of others Examples, but is forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to Sin, tho' we had few Examples for it. Nay, evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and corrupt Deſires are ſo powerful within us, that even the beſt Inſtructions, and the moſt pious Examples, and all other good Means and Helps, are daily found too weak and unable to Overcome 'em. And yet as if all this were little enough, there are far more Examples abroad in the World of Wickedneſs, than of Goodneſs; inſomuch that by the <hi>World</hi> in Scripture, ſimply taken, is often meant no other, than <hi>wicked Men,</hi> they make up ſo great a Part thereof. And not only too many Great Men, whom you have an Awe of, do give moſt abominable Examples of Profaneneſs, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Inferiors; but to come nearer Home to you, too few of your Parents and Maſters, I am afraid, are Examples to you of Religion, and of the Fear of God. Nay, and perhaps ſome that you have an Eſteem for, and you may take for Good Men, may be Examples of Schiſm and Separation, and of breaking the Unity of the Church, and deſpiſers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in one Kind, or other, not ſo Good as they ſhould be, not entirely and uniformly Good.</p>
            <p>And now what muſt you do in this Caſe? Why by all means you muſt Renounce and Refuſe Conformity to ſuch bad Examples.<note place="margin">We muſt by all Means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to ſuch bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For</note> You muſt by no means follow the Examples of Sin, be they who, or what they will. Let them be never ſo many, you muſt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Multitude to do Evil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. It will not afford the leaſt Eaſe to the Torments of the Damned, that they are the many, and that the Saved are the few. Nor muſt the Examples of the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> no, nor of thoſe you count <hi>Good Men,</hi> be a Rule to you, when they vary from the Laws of God. There is no Man ſo <hi>Great, Wiſe,</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> that he can diſpenſe with God's Laws, and abſolve you from your Allegiance to the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth. This Great Man, or that Parent, or Maſter, to flatter and pleaſe whom, you do follow their Examples in ſinning againſt God, and your own Soul, cannot afford you Protection from God's Wrath, nor Reſcue you from under the Stroak of Divine Vengeance: No, but he ſhall be as liable to it himſelf, as the pooreſt Slave.</p>
            <p>No, Firſt, a Chriſtian, a Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, is call'd out to Combat againſt the wicked Examples of the World, as much as againſt any one ſort of Enemy in his Chriſtian Warfare;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> A Chriſtian is call'd out to Combat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the World, as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any one ſort of Enemy in his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare.</note> and be they never ſo many, never ſo mighty, he muſt not be over-born by 'em, ſo as to Conform himſelf unto 'em, and either Renounce his Faith, or commit any Sin by the influence of ſuch numerous and mighty Examples. We read the 2d of <hi>Kings,</hi> that in the Days of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo Apoſtatiz'd from the true Religion, that <hi>Eliſha thought there was but himſelf left alone,</hi> who had not through the influence of ſo many Idolatrous Examples, and the Power of that wicked Prince (together with the Corruption of their own Hearts, ſo prone to Idolatry) he thought there was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40806:106"/> 
               <hi>Not one man left in Iſrael, who had not bowed his knee to Baal.</hi> But he was never the more ſtagger'd for all that, but preſerv'd himſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a true Worſhiper of the True God. And for the Encouragement of you, who are Children and Servants, if it has been your misfortune to be Born of wicked Parents, and Bred up in ungodly Families, conſider that <hi>There was found ſome good thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> for which God had a Regard to him, even in <hi>Abijah</hi> the Son of wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Sin, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.13. And <hi>Obadiah</hi> preſerv'd himſelf a good Man, even in the Houſe of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> Chap. 18.13. And ſo muſt you likewiſe, as you will approve your ſelves faithful Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, be wrought upon by no Examples to comply with Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nay, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front their bad Examples with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent One of his own.</note>Nay, Secondly, So far muſt a Chriſtian be from <hi>Conforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to the Examples of wicked Men, which would Influence him to Sin, that he is call'd forth to do more, Namely, to confront their bad Ones, with an extraordinary good One of his own; and in the midſt of an <hi>Evil and Adulterous Generation,</hi> he muſt ſhew himſelf an excellent Example of Religion and Vertue. Hence it is, that in the Fifth of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> of us Chriſtians it is ſaid, that we muſt be the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> ver. 13. that we muſt be the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and a <hi>City ſet on a Hill, that cannot be hid,</hi> and a <hi>Candle, not put under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick,</hi> ver. 14, 15. And laſtly, we are there commanded, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>To let our Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee our good Works, and glorify our Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> It is therefore, that we are thus Repreſented, becauſe, that by the Excellency of our Examples, we muſt be as Salt to a corrupted World, to Seaſon and Recover it from its Corruption; that by the Eminency of all Chriſtian Vertues and Graces, ſhining in our Converſations, we muſt Enlighten the dark World; and lead 'em, by the Brightneſs of our good Examples, into Holineſs and Purity of Living. So much it lies upon you, not to Conform your ſelves to evil Examples, that would lead you into Sin, that by the Goodneſs of your own, you muſt draw others off from it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> When they ſhall Tempt and Entice us by their evil Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note>Secondly, <hi>You muſt Refuſe to Conform your ſelves, as to the Examples, ſo to the Company of wicked Men, when falling amongſt 'em they would entice you to join with 'em in Sin.</hi> As there are a great many more of bad Examples abroad in the World, than good Ones: So the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof is a great deal more taking, when a many of thoſe bad Men are met together in Company, than when they remain aſunder from one another. And ſo much Charm there is to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch,<note place="margin">The Company of the Wicked extreamly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious.</note> or Power in ill Company to Enforce others to ſinful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, that even ſober and good Men, when it is their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to fall amongſt ſuch, ſhall hardly preſerve their Integrity, and come off from amongſt 'em with as much Innocence, as they went in; but either thro' the Noiſineſs of their Companions, forgetting that Guard they have at other times over their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds; or for Fear of being Reproacht as <hi>moroſe, dull,</hi> or <hi>ill-natur'd,</hi> ſhall too far many times comply with the Reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, both in Speaking, and Acting, what is not very conſiſtent with the Duty and Reſervedneſs of a Chriſtian. But as for the young, ignorant, and inconſiderate Part of Mankind, Good God! What Miſchiefs are ſuch drawn into, through the Enticements of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40806:106"/> Evil Company. Your lewd Companions indeed, as they are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very Buiſy in doing Miſchief, and Corrupting others; and will wonderfully Triumph and Rejoyce, when they have Perverted a Sober Perſon, and made him as Bad as Themſelves: So they are above all Induſtrious, to Corrupt and Enſnare Youth, that they may Propagate a Generation, as Wicked as they have been. And how will they Hug themſelves, when they have Debaucht an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Young Perſon, and made him at any time Drunk, or betray'd him into Lewdneſs, or any other Wickedneſs; eſpecially if of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Hopes, and of ingenious Parts; and how many Wiles ſhall be us'd to Enſnare him again? <hi>Their Mouth is full of Deceit and Fraud, under their Tongue is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Vanity, they ly lurking in the Thieviſh Corners of the Streets, to wait for the Innocent, to draw him into their Net,</hi> Pſal. 10.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>If you look into the particular Miſcarriages of Men in the World,<note place="margin">Moſt of the Miſcariages of Men ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto</note> what a Lamentable thing it is to conſider, How many hopeful Youth have wofully Miſcarry'd through wicked Company? How many have we known go Abroad into the World, the Hopes of their Families, the Expectations of their Country, and the moſt Promiſing Perſons of the Nation, but Falling into ill Company, have prov'd the moſt outragious Fiends on this ſide Hell? And what Vices, what Villanies are there, that Evil Company has not drawn 'em into?</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay? It is Evil Company, that makes the Youth an Atheiſt.<note place="margin">This makes Men Atheiſts</note> Alas! The unwary Stripling no ſooner goes into the World, but theſe Factors for the Devil lay hold on him; and with all the wily Inſinuations, and cunning Artifices, with Arguments beſt ſuited to the Temper of the Young Man, they Perſwade him to join with 'em in their lewd Courſes. They do uſually Enter him at firſt in your Taverns, and thoſe Places of publick Entertainment, that are ſomething more Remote from, and ly, as it were, only on the Highway to Sin. They next carry him from thence into the very Suburbs of Hell, thoſe Houſes, I mean, where ſuch Scenes of Lewdneſs are ſeen and acted, as would Profane the Place we are in, to mention, as are not fit to be ſpoke to Chaſt Ears, nor indeed can Enter your Thoughts, without leaving behind ſome baſe Defilement. And now if he has that Talent, which they call Wit, ſuch a ſhare at leaſt, as will enable him to talk Profanely, to break Jeſts upon Scripture, and, Oh Brutiſh Stupidity! Oh deſperate Madneſs! To Blaſpheme, and fly into the Face of God Almighty; they feed his Vanity with loud Applauſes, and cry up to the Skies his Wit and Parts. And by this he thinks himſelf ſufficiently furniſht, to be an Apoſtle of Satan's alſo himſelf; and henceforwards you ſhall ſee him, to be Intent wholly upon this very thing, to draw all others into the ſame Damnation alſo along with him.</p>
            <p>Alas! It is nothing but Evil Company,<note place="margin">Libertines.</note> that Emboldens the Young Man for lewd Pranks. At firſt he is Aſham'd to have his Name up amongſt lewd Companions, and his Natural Modeſty will not let him look an Harlot in the Face; but they ſoon Laugh him out of that Clowniſh Shameface'dneſs, ſo that he can at length Sin with Impudence enough, can Glory in his Shame, and Brag of more mad Exploits, than he was ever guilty of Committing; and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40806:107"/> is with the greateſt Eaſe drawn aſide to his Deſtruction, by every lewd Harlot, that lies in wait for him; as <hi>Solomon</hi> moſt excellently obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>It is evil Company, that draws ſo many into the ſad Trade of Thievery and Robbery.<note place="margin">Thieves, and Robbers.</note> They entice and inviegle others to join with 'em in thoſe deſperate Undertakings, in which ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, that not One in a Hundred, that being once Engag'd, can rid himſelf of 'em, or comes not at laſt to ſome End of Shame, or Sorrow. And there are few of thoſe, who are Condemn'd for Theft, or Murder, when they come to Dye, but wofully complain in their Confeſſions, that it was evil Company, that brought them to it. Come ſay they, with thoſe in the <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. <hi>Let us lay wait for Blood, let us ſwallow them up as the Grave, and whole as thoſe, that go down into the Pit, we ſhall find all precious Subſtance, fill our houſes with Spoil, caſt in thy Lot amongſt us, let us all have one Purſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evil Company, that makes Men Drunkards<note place="margin">Drunkards.</note> and Sots. There is not One at firſt however, that loves Drinking for Drinking ſake: 'Tis the Witchery of good Fellowſhip, as they falſly call it, that firſt Enters 'em, and afterwards holds 'em in that Courſe of Living, to the Ruine of their Families, their Eſtates, their Health, their Bodies, their Souls; and all that is Precious in this, or the other World.</p>
            <p>It is Evil Company, that often keeps ſome from Church, and the Worſhip of God,<note place="margin">Withdraws from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</note> that perſwades ſome to idle at Home, others to wander in the Streets and Fields, whilſt they ſhould be a ſerving of God in his Houſe. What ſhall I ſay? It is Evil Company, that diſcourages from all Good, and hardens Men in all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>The faireſt Veſſels have ſplit upon this Rock, the moſt promiſing Hopes and Expectations of Families, of their Countries, have been Ship-wrackt, have been loſt in this Sea.</p>

My Son if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not, nay my Son walk not in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path.</hi> No, go not into their Company, <hi>Evil Communications corrupt good Manners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.33. 'Tis dangerous even to Talk with 'em, but Aſſociate thy ſelf to 'em upon no account. There is Contagion and Infection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are. Thou may'ſt enter a Houſe infected with the Plague, tread upon the Adder's Neſt, put thine Hand into a Lion's Den; but on no Hand enter the Society of thoſe Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> who ſeem to defy Heaven with Oaths and Blaſphemies, ſtrive to load themſelves with ſo much of that Helliſh Guilt, as if they fear'd they ſhould not ſink deep enough into the bottomleſs Pit.

            <p>And, Firſt, Particularly you that are Young Women, let me warn you to ſhun the Company of thoſe Young Men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Young women muſt ſhun the corrupt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of young Men.</note> be they who they will, who ſhall offer to talk looſely, and lewdly, and wantonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40806:107"/> with the beſt Education and Breeding. But as to offer at Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fooliſh Talking before you, is the greateſt Affront any can give you, as ſignifying no good Opinion they have of you; ſo Young Men will not have the Confidence to Entertain you ſo Indecently and Rudely, if at the very firſt Offers of that Nature, you ſhall appear to conceive that Anger and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as infinitely becomes the modeſty of your Sex to put on. And I am ſure you would, both heartily deteſt ſuch Converſation, and not fail to ſhew your Deteſtation thereof, if you would ſeriouſly conſider what the Apoſtles ſays of it, Eph. 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>Fornication and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints: Neither Filthineſs, nor fooliſh Talking, nor Jeſting, which are not convenient; For this know, that no Whoremongers, nor unclean Perſon, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of God, and of Chriſt. Let no man deceive you, for becauſe of theſe words cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> Pray obſerve this whole Paſſage of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 
               <q>Wanton and laſcivious Diſcourſe is as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious as the very Plague, and kindles ſuch a Fire of Luſt, as without Repentance will certainly bring you to the Fire of Hell:</q> Therefore fail not to expreſs your utmoſt Abhorrence thereof; and if you cannot ſtop it, fly from thoſe that utter it, as from Perſons infected with a Plague-Sore, having ſuch an Air of Anger, and Indignation, and Abhorrence, as you go off, as no Man dare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſturb you with the like.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Secondly, it concerns all ſort of Perſons of either Sex, both Young and Old, as they would prevent Infection of evil Company,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> All Perſons of either Sex, both Young, and Old, as they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Company, muſt take all poſſible Care to avoid it.</note> and conſidering how dangerous it is to be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: And how the Tincture of their Manners and Cuſtoms, with whom we do frequently Converſe, is obſerv'd to ſlide inſenſibly into our Imitation, ſo as to be hardly ever after wore off: All theſe things conſider'd, It concerns you, I ſay, to take all poſſible Care to avoid the Company of bad Men. I ſay, to avoid it, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for it is not always, nay it is very rarely in this State of the World, that it can be done: <hi>For if ye muſt not Company with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators of this world, or with the Covetous, or Extortioners, or with Idolaters; then muſt ye needs go out of the world,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10.</p>
            <p>The Truth of it is, your Employment and neceſſary Occaſions, as to moſt of you, is, or will be ſuch, that you will unavoidably be drawn forth into the World; and the World we know is full of Atheiſtical and profane Perſons, and common Swearers, of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and riotous Livers, of debauch'd and lewd Companions; and laſtly, of the Contemners of God, and Religion; and I am afraid it is the general Converſation now a-days, of thoſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to break Jeſts, and laugh at one another upon theſe their Diſhonours done to God, and Religion, whereby they <hi>Do not only do ill things themſelves, but have pleaſure in them that do them,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> does add, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. as the higheſt Aggravation of all Impiety.

            <p>Why, Thirdly, Truly when it thus happens to you, that your Employment, and neceſſary Occaſions draw you forth into the World that which you have then to do, is to refuſe to Conform your ſelves to the Manners of ſuch Company.<note place="margin">But, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and neceſſary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions draw Men forth in to the World, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Manners of ill Company.</note>

               <hi>THE Eighteenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
            <p>THAT which I am now upon is, to Forewarn you againſt the Temptations of the wicked World, by ſhewing you the dangerous Ones you ſhall meet withal, from the <hi>Wicked Men of the World, and in what Sence, and how far you muſt Renounce both them, and their wicked ways of Tempting others to Sin.</hi> This I have already done, as to their <hi>Evil Examples,</hi> and <hi>Evil Company,</hi> and have deliver'd theſe Inſtructions to you, that by God's Help may, I hope, be ſufficient to prevent your being infected by the Poiſon of either. But the wicked Men of the World, have other ways of Tempting Men to Sin, and what they are, and how bravely you muſt Reſiſt them, I am next to declare unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Flattery a great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Sin.</note>Thirdly, Then, amongſt the greateſt Temptations proceeding from Evil Men, we may deſervedly reckon their <hi>Flatteries.</hi> Now the Flatterer is One, who obſerving the general Self-love and Pride of Mankind, who cannot endure Reproof, or any thing that ſhews a Diſlike of what they ſay, or do, does compoſe himſelf to Admire and Extol, or at leaſt-wiſe to Approve, as Well-done, very bad Actions, or at beſt ſuch, as if Good in themſelves, are but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Perform'd.</p>
            <p>The Ground of his Flattery, I ſay, is <hi>That immoderate Self-love</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ground thereof our own immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Self-love</note> he obſerves Natural to moſt Men, whereby they do extravagantly eſteem and admire their own Performances, and can ſee no Defects therein: And therefore, whoever ſhall endeavour to diſcover their Faults, tho' in never ſo Prudent a manner, to any of theſe Self-admirers, he is preſently lookt upon as One, that either envies his Abilities and good Qualities, or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to the fooliſh <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians: He is therefore become his Enemy, becauſe he tells him the Truth,</hi> Gal. 4.16.</p>
            <p>And now the Flatterer obſerving this predominant Humour in him, puts on the Vizard of a Friend, <hi>And compoſes himſelf to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and Extol, or at leaſt-wiſe to Approve, as Well-done, his very bad Actions, or at beſt ſuch, as if Good in themſelves, are very indifferently Perform'd.</hi> The Flatterer's care is to Pleaſe, not to Profit him, to whom he pretends to be a Friend, to make a Prey of the beſotted Self-admirer, and therefore ſooths him up in his Vices; he calls his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40806:109"/> Profaneneſs, Wit; ſhe that is Superſtitious, Devout; the Prodigal and Profuſe, he ſtiles Bountiful and Liberal; and the Covetous Worldling, from whom he expects an Eſtate, or Legacy, he Extolls to his Face, for his Prudence in managing his Affairs: The Oaths and Curſes, the Riot and Debaucheries of the wicked Crew he happens amongſt, he laughs at, as brave Exploits, and applauds them as the Standards of Wit and Bravery. And as to ſuch things, which are tolerably well Perform'd, but might be Better'd, for fear of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the <hi>Vanity of the Creature,</hi> whereby he might poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, he diſcovers nothing of that, but <hi>all is Well,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably Perform'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this Flattery to the Vices and Imperfections of Men is of miſchievous Conſequence to 'em. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.28.<note place="margin">This Flattery keeping Men ignorant of the good or ill Qualities in 'em there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> 
               <hi>A flattering Mouth worketh Ruine;</hi> and 29.5. <hi>A man that flattereth ſpreadeth a Net.</hi> For why? <q>The Flatterer, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, endeavours to make every Man his own Cheat, by keeping him ignorant of of the good and ill Qualities, which are in him, whereupon the Good never come to Perfection, and the Ill grow Incorrigible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this means, I ſay, <hi>The Good never come at Perfection.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Good never come to Perfection.</note> There is many a Perſon of a Generous Temper, who delights to do Good to Mankind, whoſe Head is working for the Publick, and loves to relieve the Needy; but all this 'tis viſible he does too much out of Oſtentation, and to get the Praiſe of Men, and ſo loſes his Reward from God: But now if he had but a faithful Monitor, that would fairly repreſent to him the Vanity and Affectation, that appears in the Good he does, and which others can ſee, tho' he himſelf is not ſenſible of. And that it is but to direct it to a right End, and then he will obtain a Reward in Heaven, and moreover merit the Praiſes of Men too: A little of this Sincerity and Freedom would make that Man an excellent Perſon, whom now his Vanity and Braging of the Good he does, renders Troubleſom and Hateful even to thoſe, whom he moſt Obliges. There is alſo many a One, who in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects concerning his own Advantage, and that of the Publick, out of an over-fond Conceit of his own Methods, diſdaining to ask Counſel; or if he did, they flattering every thing, and not ſincerely giving their Advice; the Deſign it ſelf therefore, and the meaſures of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, tho' Good in the main, has for that very reaſon alone miſ-carry'd: So much does the Self-flattery of our own Hearts, join'd with the Flatteries of other Perſons, hinder our Good from arriving to Perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Ill that is in Men does thereby grow Incorrigible.</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the Ill that is in Men does thereby grow Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible.</note> Thus there is not a greater Cauſe at this Day of that Profaneneſs and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Sin and Debauchery, than the Aſſentations, Smiles, and other Tokens of Approbation given by baſe Flattery, to horrid Wickedneſſes; whereas would every Chriſtian, as he is infinitely bound to do, expreſs his Diſlike, his Abhorrence, his Scorn of the Debauchees, and their Debaucheries, when they are openly Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or impudently Brag'd of, the impious Sinners of this Age would then endeavour to be Private however, not <hi>Affect,</hi> as they do, to be Publick in their Villanies. This baſe Flattery, of which there are but few, who are not Guilty, in not putting a Frown at leaſt-wiſe, inſtead of a Smile, upon impious Doings, has tended
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40806:110"/> extreamly to harden the young Reprobates of our Age to their own, and the Nation's Ruine; for indeed, as the excellent <hi>Plutarch</hi> Expreſſes it, <q>When Vice is Extoll'd, ſo that a Man is induc'd to Sin, not only without Regret, but with Joy and Triumph, and is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beyond the modeſty of a Bluſh for his Enormities: This ſort of Flattery has been fatal to whole Kingdoms.</q> And tho' indeed the Great Ones are moſt ſubject to it, becauſe they of all Men, will not endure Reproof; yet there are not any ſo mean, we ſee, whoſe Vices are not Applauded amongſt their Companions, rather than Reprehended, and who are not therefore hardned thereby into all manner of Wickedneſs. In a word, It is this ſort of Flattery, which amongſt all Ranks and Degrees of Men, <hi>Has ſtrengthened the hands of the Wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way,</hi> Ezek. 13.22. So miſchievous a Temptation, you ſee, is Flattery; it hinders all ſorts of Perſons from improving their Vertues, and encourages 'em to the higheſt Pitch of Wickedneſs. And now what muſt be done in this Caſe, that you may effectually Renounce it, and avoid the ill Effects of it? And in order thereunto,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let me Adviſe you, with the excellent Philoſopher now mention'd, that <hi>We Caſhire every vain Opinion of our ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> In order to Renounce flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we muſt Caſhire eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our own ſelves.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Inbred Flattery only diſpoſes and prepares us to a more favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that from without:</hi> For he who loves to be Flatter'd, is doubtleſs ſufficiently fond of himſelf; and thro' abundance of Complaiſance to his own Perſon, not only wiſhes, but thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of all thoſe Perfections, which may Recommend him to others. But did we reflect upon our own Nature and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſider what groſs Imperfections and Failures, mixt with our Words, Actions and Affections, we ſhould not lie ſo open to the Attempts of every Flatterer, who deſigns upon us; and we ſhould be well prepar'd to Renounce and Reject all his deceitful Flatteries, which muſt be done:</q> For</p>
            <p>Secondly, Having thus diſ-poſſeſt your Breaſts of an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Self-love, you muſt <hi>So far renounce and reject the Flatteries of Men, as to take it kindly, when you are Reprov'd.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> We muſt ſo far Renounce the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Men, as to take it kindly to be Reproved.</note> And indeed you are to Eſteem and Love him, as your trueſt Friend, who deals ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly with you, as frankly to diſcover to you your Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Failings of any Kind, and freely to reprove you for your Faults. <hi>David</hi> deſired ſuch a Friend, who would thus Reprove him, Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and let him Reprove me, and it ſhall be an excellent Oyl, which ſhall not break my Head;</hi> intimating of the Flatteries of wicked Men, which in the other Tranſlation are call'd <hi>precious Balms,</hi> would mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wound him. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who beſt knew what Wiſdom was, and the methods of Attaining it, does moſt frequently ſpeak of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as a moſt excellent One, <hi>The Ear that heareth the Reproof of Life, abideth among the Wiſe; He that refuſeth Inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own Soul; but he that feareth Reproof, getteth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Prov. 15.31, 32. But on the contrary, to hate Reproof, is in his account the High-way to Error, Ruine and Deſtruction. Thus Prov. 10.17. <hi>He that refuſeth Reprooferreth.</hi> and 15.10. <hi>He that hateth Reproof ſhall dye.</hi> and 29.1. <hi>A man of Reproof, that hardneth his Neck ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> This
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40806:110"/> indeed, as any other Diſcipline is diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood, but it is in it ſelf the moſt profitable ſort of Correction, for <hi>A Reproof entereth more into a Wiſe man than Stripes,</hi> Prov. 17.10.</p>
            <p>And as you muſt bring your ſelf to that humble and low Opinion of your own Perfections, and to that ſenſe of your Faults,<note place="margin">Eſpecially the Reproofs of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to be kindly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> as to take kindly the Reproof of a Friend, and to amend upon it; ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you are to receive, with all Reverence, and Reſpect, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Reproofs of God's Miniſters, tending either to better, or reform you. Of all Men living it muſt not be expected from us, to favour you in any thing amiſs, to ſmile upon your Extravagancies, to ſpeak only Comforts and Conſolations to you, when we come to deal with your Conſciences, which ought to be ſearcht to the Bottom by us, and the Corruption let out. This was that Flattery, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reprehends, and ſeverely threatens in the Prophets and Prieſts of his Time, 6.13, 14, 15. But our Buſineſs is by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Catechizing, and all the Methods of Inſtruction, to give you a through Underſtanding of all the Terms and Conditions of that Covenant, wherein you ſtand Engag'd to God; to be Watchmen over your Souls, in order to diſcover your Errors and Failures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; to direct you for your better Improvement in thoſe Graces, whereunto you have already attain'd; and you muſt expect it from us, to frown upon your Follies, and boldly to Reprove you, when we perceive you to Tranſgreſs our Great Maſter's Laws. And you muſt receive all this at our Hands, not only as a neceſſary Diſcharge of our Duty, but what you muſt apply to your own Improvement and Reformation. And this if you ſhould not do, your Ruine will be imputed to it. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> warns the Young-man to beware of ſinful Extravagancies, <hi>Leſt he be brought to Mourn at the laſt, when his Fleſh and his Bones are conſumed,</hi> and to own as the cauſe of all this, <hi>That he hated Inſtruction, and that his Heart deſpiſed Reproof, that he obey'd not the Voice of his Teachers, nor inclined his Ear to them, that Inſtructed him,</hi> Prov. 5.11, 12, 13. So far therefore is the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of wicked Men to be Renounced, that Reproof on the contrary is to be Kindly receiv'd. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Wicked Men will proceed farther to Tempt others to Sin, even <hi>By their falſe and fallacious Argueings againſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Wicked Men Tempt others to Sin by their falſe and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life.</note> One would think there ſhould be none profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that ſhould openly Plead for Sin; but yet ſuch Factors and Agents Satan has amongſt us, as will openly Avow his Cauſe, and will endeavour to Perſwade you, that you are not Obliged to that Strictneſs of Living, which we Preachers are continually ſounding in Men's Ears.</p>
            <p>And to this Purpoſe you ſhall hear them Argue ſo hotly, that God no doubt is a Merciful Being, and will not ſurely for the Sins of a ſhort Life, Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Miſery. And as to the Duties of Religion, you ſhall hear 'em argue, that they are hard Sayings, and who can bear 'em. And as to themſelves, you ſhall hear theſe Men often Pleading, that they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and therefore ſure God will not require Men, upon the Hazard of Salvation, to mortify the Fleſh; and that they are ſet in a World full of Temptations, and abounding in Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and that therefore God, who has Plac'd 'em in it, will not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40806:111"/> command 'em upon Pain of Damnation, to Overcome theſe ſtrong Temptations, and to deny theſe Pleaſures of the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the common, and pernicious, and licentious Argueings of Men, to perſwade both themſelves and others into ſuch eaſy Notions of God and Religion, that they may Sin with more Security, and leſs Fear. And this has been a powerful Art in all times; and ſuch Arguments as theſe Men are moſt ready to Believe, becauſe they love the Thing they Plead for, becauſe they favour their Luſts, and grant 'em ſo much Liberty in what they long for, the ſatisfying the Fleſh, and enjoying the World.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">All which wicked Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings we muſt fortify our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; as when they Plead</note>But do you beware, and fortify your ſelves well againſt thoſe falſe Argueings of Sinful men, in Behalf of their Luſts, and againſt the Strictneſs of Religion, whereby they would Perſwade you, as well as themſelves, into a ſinful Security, and with-draw you from, or ſlacken you in your Duty. They are <hi>falſe and fallacious Arguments,</hi> that would perſwade us to Comply in the leaſt with Sin, for there is nothing more plain in Scripture, than that Sin muſt with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Care be avoided. It tells us poſitively, <hi>That we muſt deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly Luſts, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tim. 2.12. <hi>And that all that name the Name of Chriſt, muſt depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. And that all true Chriſtians muſt be <hi>Cleanſed from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. And in order to Perfection, that they muſt <hi>Cut off right Hands, and put out right Eyes, when they offend 'em;</hi> that is, any Luſts that are ſo dear and uſeful to you, as theſe Members are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 29.30. What ſhall I ſay? It tells us, that the <hi>Friendſhip of the world is Enmity againſt God, and that whoſoever will be a Friend of the world, is an Enemy of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. And then as for the Puniſhment of Sin, there is not One but has the Penalty of Eternal Death and Miſery, if Unrepented of, affixt to it. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. it is ſaid, that <hi>the Fearful,</hi> or thoſe who Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from the Faith out of fear, <hi>And unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Whore-mongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, ſhall have their part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; which is the ſecond death.</hi> This the Word of God does aſſure us, and then for Men to raiſe to themſelves Hopes of Impunity, ſo contrary to the expreſs Declarations of Scripture, when if they ſhall be miſtaken, and find after all, God's Threatnings to prove real, (as there is infinite Reaſon to believe they ſhall) this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt deſperate Preſumption in the World.</p>
            <p>But if you conſider theſe Arguments aſunder, there is no ſtrength in 'em wherefore any ſhould venture to rely upon 'em. <hi>For in the firſt place, it is in no wiſe Inconſiſtent with God's Mercy, for the Sins of a ſhort Life, to Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Miſery.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God's Mercy for the Sins of a ſhort life to Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</note> His Mercy is ſufficiently ſatisfied in laying no Tyrannical Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon us, as Satan and all falſe Gods have done upon their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Votaries. It is yet a farther Demonſtration of his Mercy, that our vertuous Performances, tho' they are their own Reward here, yet they ſhall be alſo abundantly Recompenced hereafter. He does moreover let us ſee his Mercy in his long Forbearance of us, notwithſtanding, that by our numberleſs Provocations, we do <hi>Grieve his Holy Spirit.</hi> But he has given us the greateſt Diſcoveries of his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40806:111"/> Mercy, beyond what could ever enter into the Hearts of Men to expect, when he gave his own Son to be an <hi>Atonement and Expiation</hi> for our Sins, that his Juſtice might not proceed againſt us; and when he ſent him to us with a Covenant of Grace, as an Act of Pardon, propoſing to us, not only a perfect Reconciliation with our offended God, but infinite Rewards in Heaven, if we would return to our due Obedience, and Pay him no other but a reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I think this is ſufficient for Mercy to do; and if ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable Mercies will not win upon us, it is time that as ſevere a Juſtice ſhould then take place; for we are to conſider God as the ſupreme Governour of Men, and Juſtice is as neceſſary an Attribute in Government, as Mercy.</p>
            <p>Nor is his Severity, in Puniſhing the Sins of a ſhort Life, with an Eternity of Woe and Miſery, but what is agreeable to his Juſtice and Wiſdom, as ſupreme Governour of the World. It is neceſſary in all Governments, that the Laws thereof ſhould be enforc'd with ſuch Penalties, as ſhall be ſufficient to deter People from the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of thoſe Laws. And therefore the Penalties being future, it is neceſſary they ſhould be vaſtly Great, to Over-balance the Profits, or Pleaſures of Sin, which are preſent. It may ſeem hard indeed at firſt ſight, in Humane Governments, that a Perſon for Clipping a Peice of Silver, which bears the <hi>Image and Superſcription of Caeſar,</hi> or for Stealing it from another, ſhould forfeit not only his Goods and Chattels, but alſo his Life it ſelf; but yet ſince upon the Temptations of preſent Profit, bad Men will adventure to commit ſuch Facts, and the Authority of Laws cannot otherwiſe be kept up, nor Men's Rights and Properties preſerv'd: It is not thought by the Honeſt Part of Mankind, Inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Governours, to inflict even ſuch Puniſhments, as extend to the loſs of Life. It is theſe alone are ſufficient to Out-weigh the preſent Conſideration of Profit to the Offender, and effectually to move him to live in Obedience to Government; and therefore theſe, as great as they be, are eſteem'd but Juſt and Equal. So here in the Government of God over us: The Pleaſures and Profits of Sin, to compaſs which, Men will Tranſgreſs the Laws of Heaven, are but ſhort, true it is; but yet being preſent, and the Puniſhments Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd to 'em being apprehended, by moſt Sinners, to be at a great diſtance, they are therefore generally prevailing, and Men for that Reaſon do venture to Tranſgreſs the Laws of God, (a Thing of worſe Conſequence than the Violation of Humane Ordinances;) and therefore it is no other, than what can be expected from the Juſtice and Wiſdom of the ſupreme Governour of the World, to inflict ſuch infinite and eternal Puniſhments. In ſhort, Divine Vengeance, as well as Humane, muſt be ſuch as will Over-balance the Reaſons and Motives to Sin. And the Pleaſures and Profits of Sin being preſent, and the Divine Puniſhments not taking place but in another World, according to the Fundamental Rules and Reaſons of Government, they muſt be Infinite and Eternal, and all little enough, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will not be ſufficient to ſecure our Obedience to the Laws of Heaven. So that there is no Strength in this Argument of Sinful Men, againſt the Juſtice of Eternal Torments, in the behalf of their Luſts, whereby they would perſwade you, as well as themſelves,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40806:112"/> into a moſt dangerous Security, and with-draw you from, or ſlacken you in your Duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor are the Duties of our Religion hard Sayings, which no Man can bear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> That the Duties of Religion are hard Sayings which no man can bear.</note> as they will likewiſe plead. All the Duties enjoin'd us in the Goſpel, reſpect either God, our Neighbour, or our Selves. Thoſe to God, as we find 'em laid down <hi>in pure and undefiled Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> (undefiled, I ſay, with the Inventions of Men) are no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſenſeleſs, and uncouth Obſervances, ſo much the matter of all other Worſhips beſides the Chriſtian; but are all of 'em indeed, a moſt <hi>reaſonable Service.</hi> Thoſe which reſpect our Neighbour, are no other than Acts of Juſtice, Peace, and Charity, the contrary of which would deſtroy Humane Society, or make us Beaſts of Prey one to another. And as to thoſe Duties we owe to our ſelves, why, they are no other than, that we ſhould truly and <hi>juſtly Value our ſelves,</hi> neither <hi>overmuch</hi> by Pride, nor <hi>too little</hi> by letting baſe Luſts to reign over us, or the inferiour Part of our Nature, to Domineer it over our Reaſon and Underſtanding, the Superiour, and in all Equity the governing Part of us. And what is there hard in all this, that we ſhould Quarrel with our Duty, except we count it hard, that God, who has made us reaſonable Creatures, would not ſuffer us to Transform our ſelves into unreaſonable Brutes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And this is a ſufficient Anſwer alſo, to that other Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinful Men, <hi>That they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and therefore ſure God will not require Men, upon the Forfeiture of Salvation, if they do not, to Mortify the Fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> That they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and that therefore ſure God will not require Men upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation if they do not to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Fleſh.</note> For theſe Men, who Plead thus, ought to conſider, that they conſiſt of Soul and Spirit, as well as of Fleſh and Blood; and as the Soul is Superiour, and the Governing Part within us; So it is highly Reaſonable it ſhould have the Obedience of the Other: And this is all the <hi>Mortification,</hi> which Religion puts the Fleſh to. It would keep it in Subjection to the Dictates of right Reaſon, and that is all. And tho' this Mortification of the Fleſh is to be exercis'd, by Impoſing ſome Severities ſometimes upon the Body, as by Faſting and Watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this is no more to be complain'd of, than that Refractory Children, and Servants, and Subjects muſt be ſometimes kept up under Diſcipline, as there ſhall be occaſion.</p>
            <p>Nay, but Laſtly, ſay theſe Men, <hi>God has ſet us in a World full of Temptations, and abounding with ſenſual Delights and Pleaſures; and he therefore, who has Plac'd us in it, ſure will not Command us upon Pain of Damnation, to Overcome thoſe ſtrong Temptations, and to Deny theſe Pleaſures of the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly, that God has ſet us in a World full of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and abounding with ſenſual Delights and Pleaſures; and that he therefore who has placed us in it, will not command us, upon Pain of Damnation, to over-come thoſe ſtrong Temptations, and to deny theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World.</note> And we'll grant it, that he has Plac'd us in a State of Probation and Tryal, where we have ſenſual Pleaſures and Delights, and many other Temptations, beſetting us on the one ſide, as well as the Rewards of Heaven, awaiting us on the other; and where were the Vertue, and what Place would there be for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if there were not thoſe Difficulties to Overcome? But in ſhort, there is not any thing Unreaſonable, nor a Hardſhip unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable in any thing, that God has Enjoin'd us; for the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs, which gives us the Command to do theſe things, gives us alſo the Will and Power to Obey, and beſides propoſes to us Enjoyments infinitely ſurpaſſing thoſe Worldly Pleaſures, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſuch Obedience. And ſo I have given you ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40806:112"/> to thoſe falſe and fallacious Argueings of ſinful Men, againſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life, I know 'em to be too common in the Diſcourſes of ſuch Perſons, who love their Luſts, and therefore I thought it requiſite to Fortify you againſt them.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, Fifthly, Wicked Men will not be content by the ſecret Influence of their Examples and Company only, nor by their falſe and fallacious Arguments to Tempt you to Sin, but <hi>Will moreover ſometimes add Kindneſſes and Promiſes to oblige you to do ill Things, and on the contrary will much diſcourage you, nay ſometimes Threaten you, to forbear your Duty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Wicked Men will add Kindneſſes &amp; Promiſes to Oblige us to do ill Things, and on the contrary will much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us, nay ſometimes Threaten us to forbear our Duty.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Kindneſſes of Friendſhip are of all things the moſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if your Choice of a Friend has not been ſo diſcreetly and happily made, but he happens to be a wicked Man, who upon the Score of former Obligations laid upon you, will require in Return, that ſome ill Thing ſhould be done by you to ſerve his Intereſt, you will be drawn thereby into a very great Snare; for beſides that, there is in very many, whom we call Good-natur'd Men, ſuch an Eaſineſs of Mind, that they can hardly deny any thing to thoſe, who have once Oblig'd 'em; but are ready to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Comply with 'em, tho' in things moſt directly contrary to their own Minds and Inclination. Beſides this, if you ſhould refuſe to Gratify in any thing, One that has done you former Kindneſſes, the World will be ready to call you <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful,</hi> the moſt odious Reproach, that can be caſt on any One.</p>
            <p>Nay and wicked Men will not ſometimes ſtick to <hi>Bribe you alſo with Promiſes and Propoſals of Profit and Advantages, if you will ſerve 'em in their ill Deſigns.</hi> This One would think not ſo dangerous a Temptation to Sin, becauſe more open, and not ſo Inſinuating a way as the former; but God knows, too many do knowingly and wilfully barter away their poor Souls, and plainly ſell 'em to the Devil, contracting to commit this, or that Sin; as for Inſtance, to take a falſe Oath, to forge Writings, to make a Lie in another's behalf, upon the Promiſe, or Intimation of ſome Reward for ſo doing. Thus will wicked Men, ſome by Kindneſſes, ſome by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Oblige you, if they can, to ſerve 'em by your Sins.</p>
            <p>And ſome on the other hand will be no leſs Induſtrious by <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi> nay <hi>Threatnings</hi> to hinder you in the diſcharging your Duty, and a good Conſcience. Religion will ſometimes put you upon doing thoſe things, that will prejudice your worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſtir up the Wrath of thoſe, that are Superior to you. And indeed in this Caſe, a <hi>Man's worſt Enemies ſhall be thoſe of his own Houſe;</hi> and when either you muſt Sin, or Suffer, none will be ſo forward to Tempt you to Sin, rather than to Suffer, as your neareſt Relations and Acquaintance: And what muſt Wife, and Children, and Family do, if you ſhould talk of Forſaking all, and of following Chriſt in the Preſervation of a good Conſcience, will be Argument, that the Friend of your own Boſom will ſtrongly urge you withal.</p>
            <p>But the more common Temptation diſcouraging Men in the Diſcharge of their Duty, eſpecially ſuch as are of a low Rank and Condition in the World, are the Frowns and Threats of thoſe, that are above 'em. Hence a Miniſter in low Circumſtances, ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:40806:113"/> venture hard, if he offers to Reprove a Great Man, tho' a Great Sinner. And you ſhall ſcarcely ever know an Officer, tho' never ſo ſtrictly oblig'd thereunto by his Oath, preſent, in order to Puniſhment, the Man of Power and Intereſt in his Pariſh, for his Oaths, his Riots, and the moſt outragious Immoralities, which he ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly commits.</p>

            <p>And now, Laſtly, I cannot call to Mind any other Temptations,<note place="margin">Laſtly, The evil Cuſtoms, which have prevailed in the World, are a powerful Temptation to Sin.</note> uſual amongſt wicked Men, to Tempt others to Sin, beſides <hi>Some Evil Cuſtoms ſo riſe amongſt many.</hi> That the Heathen Idolatries, and thoſe filthy Practices, committed in 'em, were ſo univerſally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, by all ſorts of Men in the Pagan World, was, becauſe they were Commended and Eſtabliſhed by Publick Cuſtom. Many of their wiſeſt Men and Philoſophers, had other Conceptions of God, than to think it was fit, to <hi>Change the Glory of God, into the Similitude of an Ox, that eateth Graſs;</hi> and thought alſo, he ought to be Worſhipt, not by Fooleries and Impurities, but with a chaſt Mind and a clean Heart. And yet even thoſe Men ſubmitted to <hi>Common Cuſtom,</hi> and whatever they thought, or ſpoke Privately, amongſt themſelves, they acted and ſpoke in Publick, as the reſt did. And it was to the Prevalency of Cuſtom, that the Apoſtle imputed thoſe Enormities of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> before their Converſion, telling 'em, that <hi>In time paſt they walked according to the Courſe of this World,</hi> Eph. 2.2. And indeed ſo great is the Power of Evil Cuſtom, that it does ſtill, amongſt Chriſtians, conſtrain Perſons to do many ill Things, even contrary to their Nature and Inclinations, as well as Religion. And when grown prevalent and common, it does ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take off the ſence and fear of Hurt, in the moſt Unchriſtian Practices.</p>
            <p>Cuſtom, I ſay, does ſtill amongſt Chriſtians, conſtrain Perſons to do many ill Things, even contrary to their Nature and Inclinations, as well as Religion. Hence among the <hi>Men of Honour,</hi> as they would be thought, ſhall many become even Self-murderers, meerly in Compliance with Cuſtom; inſomuch, that thoſe Perſons, who of all men Living, have moſt reaſon to preſerve their Lives, having all their good Things they can ever expect, in this World, yet deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſpill one another's Blood in your curſed Duels.

So again, among Perſons of all Ranks, you ſhall have men of no manner of Inclinations to Intemperate Drinking, yet when they come to any Great Man's Houſe, where it is the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and brutiſh Cuſtom of <hi>Drinking Men hard:</hi> Yet at ſuch times they will not ſcruple to Exceed very far.

               <note place="margin">Such only as are Immoral are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note>I do ſay, All Cuſtoms that are <hi>Immoral:</hi> For I do not mean, that a Chriſtian muſt turn Cynick, a dogged and ſower Lump of Earth, ſurly, and uncivil, and quarrelling with the innocent Modes of Humane Society. That is as much a Fault on the other ſide, to think that Chriſtianity, the calmeſt and the ſweeteſt Religion in the World, does oblige Men to ill Manners. But thoſe Cuſtoms, the Force of whoſe Temptations I would have you all to Reſiſt,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40806:114"/> and utterly to Renounce, are ſuch as I before mention'd, and which are apparently ſinful and wicked, either tending to leſſen the Guilt of Sin, or to make it none at all.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible there is ſomething of Difficulty in this Part of our Warfare above any other. Barely to refuſe Compliance with, but much more to oppoſe Evil Men in their ſinful Cuſtoms and Practices, will mightily provoke their Indignation. He ſails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wind that does ſo, and ſwims againſt the Stream. He ſhall have Multitudes will thwart him, and will load him with hard Reproaches; will call him ſingular and preciſe Fool for his Pains, and what not? He muſt have a great deal of Courage that oppoſes a Multitude in doing Evil, or will not comply with 'em in it. But ſuch muſt the Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt be, One that dares Incur the greateſt Diſpleaſure, rather than ſhrink from his Duty; and One that will not be afraid to ſhew his Diſlike of any vicious Cuſtoms, when there is juſt Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>And this indeed is true <hi>Courage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The greateſt Courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this Part of a Chriſtian's Warfare.</note> to deſpiſe all Oppoſition in the way of Duty, and he that can Unconcernedly paſs through a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Reproaching and Vilifying him for his Pains, in Purſuit of Vertue, is more Heroick and Brave, than he that with his Sword in his Hand cuts open a way to the Taking of a Fort. He that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves a Sin, or Renounces an Ungodly Cuſtom, may have more of true Fortitude, than he that Puſhes on through drawn Swords, for it is a ſign he fears not thoſe Weapons which wound deepeſt, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd and envenom'd Tongue.</p>
            <p>It is plain beyond all Contradiction, I do think,<note place="margin">Cowardice the Cauſe of Complying with the Custome of Duelling, or any other Cuſtom of Sinning.</note> that when Men in Oppoſition to their Inclination, and Reaſon, and Religion dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the contrary, do comply with others in Drinking of Healths to Exceſs, in profane or looſe Talk, or the like: It is plain, I ſay, that it is out of fear of Reproaches, and for want of Courage, that Men do thus Sin. Nay, I dare be bold to affirm, however like a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox it may appear to ſome, That it is out of Fear, and for want of true Courage, that Men fight Duels, when they are Provokt, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted. They are afraid, that if in Compliance to our Saviour's Doctrines of Meekneſs, Patience and Forbearance, they ſhould put up Affronts, they would be Reproacht and Scorn'd by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and be term'd Cowards, and therefore do deſperately (but enough againſt their ſecret Inclinations, I dare ſay) betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Barbarous and Fool-hardy way of ſhewing themſelves Men of Honour.</p>
            <p>But true Courage and Bravery, Philoſophy, and Religion, and the ſober Reaſon of all wiſe Men tell us, will deſpiſe the vain Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Unthinking and Impious Croud, which, for the moſt part, are in the wrong; and will ſteddily purſue what is Vertuous, and Fit, and Reaſonable, and Religious, notwithſtanding the fooliſh Reproaches of the Many. So that to retain One's Integrity and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and an unpolluted Conſcience, in the midſt of common and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Cuſtoms of Sin and Vice, I dare be bold to aſſert, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt Heroick piece of Courage.</p>
            <p>And accordingly it will be Rewarded with a Noble Teſtimony by our Bleſſed Saviour, when to have his Teſtimony will be beyond the Applauſes of the whole World. To Renounce and Oppoſe the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40806:115"/> and Profane Cuſtoms of wicked Men, is an Eminent piece of Chriſtian Confeſſion, and <hi>He who Confeſſes him before Men, the ſame will the Son of Man Confeſs,</hi> Own as his Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and Applaud as a Noble Confeſſor, <hi>before the Angels of God,</hi> Luk. 12.8.</p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice, to have ſpoken concerning the wicked Men of the World, that you muſt ſo far Renounce both them, and their wicked ways, as <hi>Never to become Tempters your ſelves of others to Sin, nor to yield your ſelves a Prey to other Men's Temptations,</hi> but muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſe Conformity to them, and all their ways, whereby they would have you Offend God, and Violate your Covenant with him, and your Vows in Baptiſm, and thereby Forfeit all your Title, and Hopes of Happineſs.</p>

            <p>And, Firſt, As to <hi>Pomps,</hi> theſe as they were part of the Pagan Idolatries: So they were what the Primitive Chriſtians were more particularly concern'd to Renounce. But however, ſince the ſame Renunciation of the Pomps of this World, is ſtill retain'd in our Church, tho' the very ſame Things, which were at firſt meant thereby, are perhaps become Obſolete, and out of Uſe in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And yet it is not to be ſuppos'd, but that our Church had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſomething ſtill in Uſe in the Chriſtian World, as fit to be Renounc'd, under that Title, by every Diſciple of JESUS: I ſhall therefore, together with a ſhort Account of the Meaning of Pomps, in the Sence they were Renounc'd by the Primitive Chriſtians, take care, eſpecially to ſhew you, what amongſt us is moſt Analogous to the ancient Heatheniſh <hi>Pomps,</hi> and bears ſuch a near Reſemblance to 'em, as to render theſe, our modern <hi>Pomps,</hi> fit alſo to be <hi>Renounc'd</hi> by every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And, Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Thereby were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant thoſe pompous Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, Plays and Scenical Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exhibited in the Roman Theaters.</note> By Pomps were Anciently meant (in the Opinion of our Learned and Excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) thoſe Pompous Shows and Spectacles exhibited by the Emperors, and Great Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Roman Theaters, wherein Multitudes of Captive Wretches were put to Slay one another in their Sword-Plays, for the Diverſion of the People. And indeed it is not unlikely, that thereby may be meant, not only thoſe Bloody Sword-Plays, but all thoſe <hi>Scenical Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Plays</hi> whatever, Acted in Memory of their falſe Gods, upon their Great Feſtivals, which were ſometimes ſo very Lewd and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, (for Inſtance thoſe, which were Acted in Honour of <hi>Flora,</hi>) that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were aſham'd to proceed in 'em,<note place="margin">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40806:116"/> Affections ſo ſadly alienated from the Love of God and Goodneſs: All theſe things conſider'd, 'twere greatly to be wiſht, our Play-Houſes were totally ſuppreſt. However, in the mean time, I think it concerns all, that will be ſecure from ever Apoſtatizing from the Faith of Chriſt, and a Religious Life, ſo far to Reject theſe our modern Pomps, as never to Enter within thoſe Houſes, where theſe Plays are acted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, By Pomps, in the Sence of the Ancients (as ſome do think) are meant the Solemn <hi>Proceſſions</hi> of the Heathens,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> By Pomps in the ſence of the Ancients were meant, the ſolemn Proceſſions of of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Gods.</note> wherein they carried the Images of their Gods, through the Streets of the City, in a moſt Pompous manner, all the Prieſts, Magiſtrates, and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> does Repreſent it, Attending and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Veneration towards them.</p>
            <p>And anſwerably to theſe, without the leaſt ſtraining of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the preſent State of the Church, may be underſtood, thoſe Idolatrous Proceſſions amongſt the Papiſts;<note place="margin">The Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Papiſts, in honour of the Saints, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to theſe;</note> where ſometimes the Images of the Saints, ſometimes the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> is carried in the ſame Solemn manner, as among the Pagans, were the Images of their Gods: And the like Adoration and Worſhip requir'd from all, who accompany, or accidentally fall amongſt 'em, out of Curioſity to obſerve their Vanities. And as amongſt the Ancients, thoſe were Cenſur'd as Partakers with the Heathen in their Idolatry, who went along with them, or were publick Spectators of 'em, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifying to the Eyes of Men, their Allowance and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and of the Idolatry they contain'd; and were certain to be caſt out of the <hi>Communion of the Church</hi> for the ſame:<note place="margin">And muſt not therefore be joined in.</note> So thoſe Proteſtant Gentlemen, who Traveling into Forreign Countries, out of Curioſity to obſerve the Popiſh Vanities, ſhall Voluntarily appear amongſt the Train accompanying them, cannot be thought more Favourably of. And if through Force they are Compel'd to join in the Adoration of thoſe Images, and ſhall rather comply, than ſuffer, they are wanting in Diſcharging that great Duty of <hi>Confeſſing of Chriſt,</hi> which is ſo ſtrictly requir'd at our Hands, as ever we expect to have him <hi>Confeſs us before God, and his Holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, By Pomps may be meant reductively,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> By Pomps Reductively, may be meant the Revels &amp; Dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ken Riots of our Youth, at Wakes and Feſtivals.</note> all thoſe <hi>Revels</hi> and Riotous Meetings of Youth, whereby our Great <hi>Feſtivals</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Inſtituted by the Church, to be kept with Joyful Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to God, for his ſingular Favours vouchſafed to the World, as at ſuch times, are ſo ſadly Profan'd by Drunkenneſs, lewd Songs and Ballads, profane and wanton Diſcourſe, and the like.

But I will be bold to aſſert, with the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that beſides theſe other Sences of the Word <hi>Pomps;</hi> 
               <q>All the ſinful Courſes, that are us'd by Men in their Times of Jollity and Feſtivity, the Luxury, and Riot, and unlawful Gaming; and all Kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes (which are but a Copying out the Heathen <hi>Bacchanals</hi>) are Pomps to be Renounced by every Chriſtian. All Riot and Exceſs, lewd and wanton Actions, and Diſcourſes are Sins, and that far greater, and more puniſhable in Chriſtians, than in Others; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly than in Jews, whoſe Promiſes of an Earthly Plenty are
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40806:117"/> not ſo contrary and irreconcilable with Corporal Exceſſes, as are the ſpiritual Joys, that are the Chriſtian's eminent Portion under Promiſe. And therefore theſe are turned out of the World by Chriſt, and by him transform'd and chang'd into ſpiritual Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, bleſſing and praiſing God, into Feaſts of Charity, and ſober Hoſpitality, and Bounty to the Poor, inſtead of thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, coſtly vain Pomps, which the Eye of the World is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with.</q>

Thus to affect Sumptuouſneſs, I ſay, is a ſinful Vanity. Thus the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 22.13, 14. pronounceth a <hi>Woe unto him that buildeth his Houſe by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and his Chambers by Wrong, that uſeth his Neighbours Service without Wages, and giveth him not for his Work; that ſaith, I will build me a wide Houſe, and large Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and cutteth him out Windows, and it is cieled with Cedar, and painted with Vermilion.</hi> And as for thoſe who build, and deck, and trim up their own Houſes, and ſuffer God's Houſe to be in Ruine and Decay, to lye uncomely and naſtily, they had beſt to conſider how ill God will take it, as appears from that of <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in the cieled Houſes, and this Houſe lye waſt?</hi> And in the Verſes following, he denounceth a Conſumption on all they have, for ſuch Impiety. So ſinful a thing is the vain Affectation of ſumptuous Houſes, and rich Furniture, when
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40806:117"/> joined to the Prejudice of others, and the Contempt of God, and ſo fit therefore to be <hi>Renounced</hi> by every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> It appears in ſtriving for Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
               <hi>And ſo likewiſe is the vain Affectation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ppermoſt Places.</hi> This is a Vanity, that is perhaps more uſual amongſt the loweſt Rank of People, (which One would leaſt expect) than thoſe of Birth and Quality, tho' it is in none ſo unſeemly as in them. I have with Admiration beheld Farmers, nay, poor Tenants, nay, Labourer's Wives, ſwell till they almoſt burſt with Envy, at their Neighbour's Stepping before, or Sitting above 'em; and even in the Houſe of God, ſo expreſly contrary to our Saviour's Rule, <hi>Not to ſeek the chief Seats in the Synagogues:</hi> I have known 'em ſtrive for the uppermoſt Places, and to be whole Months, nay, Years afterwards out of Charity, and that almoſt beyond Reconciliation, meerly upon the account of Precedence: A thing ſo unſeemly, and ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a piece of Vanity, eſpecially in thoſe of lower Rank, that I can hardly forbear to expreſs my ſelf with Indignation concerning it; but I ſhall only adviſe you in the Words of our Saviour, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.38, 39. to beware of imitating the Scribes and Phariſees (the worſt Patterns you can follow) <hi>Who love the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts.</hi> It is a Pride and Vanity fit only for Scribes and Phariſees, the Proudeſt Men on Earth, but infinitely unbecoming the Diſciples of the Meek and Humble JESUS, who when they ſtrive for Place, it muſt be, not to take, but to give it, <hi>In Honour preferring one another,</hi> Rom. 12.10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Again of like Nature to this laſt piece of Vanity, is the Ambition, and vain Affectation of Titles of Reſpect and Honour above ones Quality and Degree; and the deſire to be eſteemed by others more Vertuous and Good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> In affecting Titles above ones Quality, and to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous above ones Deſert.</note> 
               <hi>than we really are in our ſelves.</hi> The meaneſt Perſons that are now a-days, will take it ill, if they have not thoſe Titles of Reſpect given them, which do not at all belong to them, and for Diſtinction ſake, are due to thoſe above 'em. And even Good Men, who can heartily own, and ſorrowfully bewail in their Confeſſions to God, that they are vile Sinners, will hardly endure that others ſhould ſay ſo, or think ſo ill of 'em. But ſo far ſhould we be from affecting ſuch Reſpects, as are above our Merit, that we ſhould not over-eagerly deſire thoſe that are deſerv'd, and due to us; nor muſt we Plume and Pride our ſelves when we have 'em. To do otherwiſe proceeds from an Ambition, which ill-becomes the Diſciples of Him, that was ſo exceeding Lowly; <hi>Who, tho' he was Lord of all, yet came here into the World, not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter,</hi> Matth. 20.28. And we ſhould not be angry with others, that do think, or ſpeak ill of us, but at our ſelves, that we deſerve to be ſo thought, or ſpoke of. And herein alſo we have our Bleſſed Saviour for our Example, who tho' <hi>He he did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth, when he was Reviled, Reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22, 23.</p>

And no doubt, as Honour is to be paid to whom <hi>Honour is due,</hi> ſo a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Habits, according to the Dignity and Quality of Perſons is allowable and uſeful; but this Diſtinction is quite loſt, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of lower Rank do ſtrive to be ſeen as early in a new Dreſs, and as Rich in their Attire, as thoſe that are above 'em.</p>

               <q>It is a kind of Adultery, ſays the Excellent <hi>Hammond,</hi> in that Woman, who not only Expoſes and Proſtitutes her ſelf to the Eyes of Men, but ſo Dreſſes, and ſets her ſelf out to that End ſhe may be thus Lookt upon, and call to her ſelf the Eyes of all Men. If ſhe ſtrike not, wound not others, ſhe ſhall yet be Puniſht; for ſhe hath mixt the Potion, prepar'd the Poiſon, tho' ſhe hath not given the Cup to Drink: Yes, and hath done that too, tho' none be found, that will Drink of it.</q> It ſeems, there is a piece of Chriſtian Chaſtity requir'd of Women in this Kind, that is not generally thought on, but would be carefully practiced, if all of the Female Sex would ſeriouſly read over, and conſider that admirable place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3. deſcribing the Vanity and Wickedneſs of Women in this Reſpect, and the Anger of God towards 'em for it. It is a Character of Women's Vanity too long here to give you, but begins at the 16th Verſe of the 3d Chapter, ending at the 25th. and you had beſt read it at your Leiſure, and you cannot too often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon it. Our Church is pleas'd to Condeſcend in one of her Homilies, to conſider the Excuſes that ſuch make, who paint their Faces, and deck themſelves in Gay Apparel, and Dreſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſtly, <q>That it is to pleaſe their Husband, to delight his Eyes, and Retain his Love towards them; but ſhe plainly tells them, That thereby they go about to pleaſe others, rather than their Husbands; that it is to provoke others to Tempt 'em, to deceive their Souls, by the Bait of ſuch Pomp and Pride, and that they make of the indecent Apparel of the Body, the Devil's Net, to catch the Souls of them, which behold 'em</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40806:118"/>
            <p>But Fourthly, and Laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, when they ſpend too much Time, and at unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Seaſons therein.</note> the Pride and Vanity of thoſe is Sacrilegious, who ſpend ſo much of their Time in this weighty Buſineſs every Morning, that they have not room to ſay their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; nay, who are ſo long and critical in Decking themſelves on the Lord's Day, that the Service of God is almoſt over before they can force themſelves from their Glaſs: Such, I ſay, are plainly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious in Robbing God of his Portion of Time, and employing that in ſetting forth their own Glory, which ſhould be wholly ſpent to his Honour. And they are moſt injurious to their own Souls in Decking their Carkaſſes with outward Ornaments, when they ſhould be Adorning their Souls with inward and Divine Graces. <q>But alas! they that are much occupied, ſays our Homily, in caring for things pertaining to the Body, are moſt commonly Negligent and Careleſs in matters, that concern the Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, But after all I am ſenſible, I have fall'n upon as Nice a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as any can be Handled, there being Nothing wherein the World will, with ſo much Uneaſineſs bear a Contradiction, as in this Point of its Vanities, and eſpecially in the matter of Apparel: For whilſt ſome are ſo Strait-lac'd, as to Cenſure every thing, that is <hi>Ornamental</hi> in our way of Living; and ſo many others, on the contrary, are ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profuſe to a high degree of Vanity, it is hard to determine this caſe, ſo as not to incur the Prejudice of one, or other. I will therefore chooſe to give, in the Words of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the true State of this matter, ſhewing what Allowances, without imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vanity, may be granted in the Uſe of <hi>Ornamentals;</hi> and how far, on the other ſide, they are to be Renounc'd by you.</p>
            <p>And herein this Great Father of our Church gives this prudent Advice, <q>That none go above what the Soberer and Graver ſort of his Quality and Condition do uſe; that they Abſtain, as much as may be, from the frequent Changing and Inventing of Faſhions, from the being earlieſt in every New Dreſs, or from Singularity of Apparel, us'd on purpoſe, and on that Affectation, becauſe it is Singular; for all theſe ſeem ſo far to Betray the ſinful Principle, that tho' it is not reaſonable, for one Man to judge another, for every thing of this nature; yet it will be fit for all, that do thus, to examine and charge it upon themſelves, and if they cannot perfectly clear themſelves from that evil Principle, or worſe End, then to remember, that this is it, which they Renounced in their Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The ſhort is this, <hi>Decency</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Nevertheleſs the Truth is, (as he goes on) it were to be wiſht, that Men and Women of the higheſt Quality, would chooſe to Diſtinguiſh themſelves from others, rather by that <hi>Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit</hi> (commended to the weaker Sex, by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as a far more amiable Ornament, than that of Apparel;) and make ſhew of their Wealth, by thoſe more profitable, beneficial Expences, for the ſupply of the Wants of others. And no doubt, this would contribute more to their own Ends, (if they be the Aims of Chriſtians) and would ſet them out more in the Opinion of all wiſe and good Perſons. But this being affirm'd, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Uſe of any of thoſe Ornaments, which are agreeable to Time, and Place, and Callings, to be Sinful, or of the Number of thoſe Vanities, that are to be Renounced in our Baptiſm.</q>

            <p>IN the Explication of theſe Words, I have fully laid before you the Stratagems and Wiles of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the various <hi>Temptations</hi> alſo wherewith the <hi>World</hi> doth aſſault us, to withdraw us from God, and to make us break our <hi>Covenant</hi> with him.

            </p>
            <p>And indeed this is a moſt Material and Important Part of Chriſtian Knowledge. To Know our ſelves, is next in Dignity and Uſefulneſs to the Knowledge of God himſelf.<note place="margin">To know our ſelves, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a moſt uſeful part of Knowledge.</note> And if we did but diſtinctly Know the Imperfection and Weakneſſes of our Corrupted Nature, and of all the Powers and Faculties within us; neither the whole World with all its formidable Hoſt of Temptations, nor Satan himſelf Marſhalling and managing of 'em againſt us, with all the Malice and Cunning he is Maſter of, would be in much danger of doing us hurt. For tho' our caſe is that of a Beſieged Fort, to take which there are not only a numerous Army, under the Conduct of a wary General, who nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly views every part of us, and orders the Attack where he finds us weakeſt; But what is worſe, the whole Fabrick of our Corrupted Nature is extremely decay'd; and all the Faculties and Powers thereof, are but ſo many Traitors within us ready to deliver us up to our Enemies. Yet however in Knowing the Weakneſs of our Nature, we may be able to repair its Decays; and by Knowing alſo the Treachery of all its Faculties, we ſhall ſucceſsfully prevent their delivering of us up to our Adverſaries: And therefore, for the more full diſcovery of ſo Uſeful and Important a Subject to you,</p>

And indeed there is not any one thing ſo variouſly expreſs'd in the Holy Striptures as this is. It is called the <hi>Old Man,</hi> as to denote the Antiquity of this Corruption, and from whom it deſcended, even from <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father of us all; ſo to ſignifie that it has univerſally infected the whole Race of Mankind. It is called the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> both becauſe this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption over-ſpreadeth the whole Nature, and becauſe it is become Natural to Man in this Corrupt State to Sin. It is called the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> becauſe the very Soul in a Man, and all its Faculties, are Carnal and Senſual.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> As ſpoil'd in his Original Frame and Conſtitution, as deſpoil'd of the Image of God, and as inordinately tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Creature</note> In order to the more perfect Underſtanding of which Matter, we muſt in the firſt place enquire what was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40806:120"/> In what the Image of God, wherein he was created at firſt, conſiſted; And how that in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, his whole Bent and Inclinations were originally Heavenward; for by thus comparing the upright Nature of Man, as it was at firſt Created, with what it now is in this State of Corruption, we ſhall be able clearly to apprehend what is meant by the Fleſh, the important Subject of our preſent Enquiry.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Original Frame and Conſtitution of our Nature,<note place="margin">The Original Frame and Conſtitution of Humane Nature, what.</note> wherein God made us, it ſeems, to have been this. He gave Man a Faculty of Underſtanding, whereby he could Contemplate upon, and Know in an Extraordinary Meaſure, the wonderful Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Creator! his Amazing Works of Creation! his Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Works of Providence! and thereby was able to diſcover the Good and Evil in any Objects that were preſented to him. Next, he plac'd in his Boſom another wonderful Faculty, called Conſcience; which is the practical Judgment in every Man, whereby his own Mind, out of that vaſt Treaſure of uſeful Knowledge, did dictate to him what was Good, and to be Choſen; what was Evil, and to be refus'd by him; and upon which Choice of Good, and Rejecting of Evil, its Office was to give its Teſtimony of Well-done, to the Good and Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to his unſpeakable Comfort and Satisfaction. Next, in the Upright Nature of Man, as it bore upon it the Image and Likeneſs of God, there was plac'd a Will, which of it ſelf is a blind Faculty, and chuſes and refuſes, according to the Information of others. And in the State of Innocence, it was entirely complying with the Dictates of Reaſon and Conſcience. And to deſcend from the Rational to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior and Bodily Powers: It was the Divine Goodneſs did implant in our Natures thoſe, which we call the Paſſions and Affections in a Man; which are principally theſe, <hi>Admiration, Love,</hi> and <hi>Hatred.</hi> And it was to very Excellent Purpoſes that theſe were given us. The Uſe of Admiration was, as to Things which ſhould offer themſelves to our Approbation; if Good, that we might put a true value upon them according to their Worth; if Bad, that we might deſpiſe 'em, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vanity and Evil we ſhould find in 'em. And as to the two other principal Paſſions of Love and Hatred, God's Deſign in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting in our hearts the former, was to move and ſtir us up with Vigour and Activity, to purſue whatever we ſhould find good and convenient to us. And the Paſſion of Hatred was put into our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we might avoid on the contrary whatever might be found Hurtful and Offenſive. And it was no other than the Divine Goodneſs, which in the Nature of Man did place certain Appetites and Luſts. Every particular Man had, even at his firſt Creation, Appetites to Food and Suſtenance, in order to preſerve his own Being in Life and Health. And Cupidity or the Inclinations of the Sex to each other, was in order to the Multiplication of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This now was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man. And in the Perfection, Order, and Purity of all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, according to this Original Frame and Conſtitution, did the Image of God, in which he was at firſt Created,<note place="margin">The Image of God, wherein Man was at firſt Created, what.</note> conſiſt. So long as the whole Nature of Man was perfect in all parts, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding quick in diſcerning momentous and weighty Truths, the Conſcience faithful in Dictating Right ways, the Will entirely Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40806:121"/> to the Directions of Conſcience and Reaſon, ſo long as the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were only plac'd upon worthy Objects, and the Luſts and Appetites were always under the Power and Government of Right Reaſon; ſo long as Man remained in this State, the Image of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unſullied.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as he continued thus, it is plain alſo, that the whole Bent and Inclination of the Soul was towards God,<note place="margin">The Bent and Inclination of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, what.</note> that to him it did point in all its Motions, and did fix upon him as the End of all its Actions; and did love him with the intenſeſt degrees of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And that even the Bodily Part was perfectly compliant with the Soul in ſerving it entirely and ſolely to that End. So that thus you ſee what was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man: In what the Image of God, wherein he was created at firſt, conſiſted: And that in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, his whole Bent and Inclinations were Heaven-ward.</p>
            <p>But now in the Unregenerate Nature all this Excellent Frame and Conſtitution is broken: This Image of God is defac'd; and all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, inſtead of Inclining towards, and Centring upon God and Heavenly Things, tend downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Creature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Unregenerate Nature, I ſay; That Excellent Frame and Conſtitution, wherein Man was Originally Created, is now broken:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> In the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, wherein he was Created, is broken.</note> So that inſtead of that Harmonious Subordination of the Inferior Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to the Superior; inſtead of the Wills being ſubject to the Dictates of the Underſtanding, and the Affections being ſubject to the Commands and Sovereignty of the Will, and the Luſts and Appetites being Obedient to Right Reaſon, and a well-inform'd Conſcience; inſtead of this, the whole Order and Frame of Humane Nature is now turn'd upſide down: The Affections, Luſts and Appetites do now Reign, and Reaſon and Conſcience are dragg'd after them in miſerable Slavery. And as to the Will of an Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man, the moſt that it can do, is not without <hi>Reluctance</hi> and <hi>Regret,</hi> to comply with the Temptations of the Senſes; like him in St. <hi>Paul, I know that in me, that is, in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing; for to will is preſent with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not; for the Good. that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> Rom. 7.18, 19. The beſt that can be ſuppos'd of the Unregenerate Man is this, that after the Preaching of the Laws of God to him, and a Divine Light has been let thereby into his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, he does approve in his own Mind of the Ways of God as moſt excellent. Such was he, in St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man;</hi> that is, according to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Superiour Faculty, contrary to the carnal or bodily part of him; ſuch a one does approve of what the Laws of God do preſcribe. But then alas he muſt own, that <hi>he ſees another Law in his Members warring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in his Members,</hi> v. 23. So that the State of an Unregenerate Man is a State of meer Confuſion, Diſorder, and Rebellion, the Affections, Luſts, and Appetites, riſing up in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Dictates of the Mind and Conſcience: And it is a State of meer Impotency and Weakneſs, the Mind and Conſcience being ſo far unable to govern the Affections, Luſts, and Appetites, that theſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40806:121"/> latter get the better of the day, carry the Mind and Reaſon captive, and force it ſlaviſhly to do what the Fleſh requires to have done by it, ſo exceedingly ſpoil'd, and broken in the Unregenerate Nature, is all that Excellent Frame and Conſtitution wherein Man was at firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And conſequently then, <hi>the Image of God,</hi> wherein Man was at firſt Created, muſt needs be miſerably defaced<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Image of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was firſt Created, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd.</note> in a State of Unregeneracy. For why? In that Excellent Perfection and Order, which appear'd in the Frame and Conſtitution of Humane Nature it was, that thoſe lively Strokes of the Divine Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, were plainly viſible. But as a miſhapen and monſtrous Picture, in which there is nothing of Regularity and good Feature, cannot without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be ſaid to Reſemble ſome Excellent and Goodly Perſonage; ſo neither can the defac'd and deform'd Nature of an Unregenerate Man be ſaid to be made <hi>after the Likeneſs of God.</hi> Some Faint and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Reſemblances, true it is, do ſtill remain under all thoſe Deface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; even as in the Ruines of a Stately Palace, there may appear ſomething of Admirable Architecture. There is ſtill remaining in the moſt Corrupt Nature; True it is, that part of the Image of God which conſiſted in thoſe things which are Eſſential to Man, as Man, that is, the Soul, and all its Faculties of Underſtanding, Will, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, theſe do ſtill remain the ſame for Subſtance as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the Image of God as it conſiſts in our Moral Perfections; <hi>viz.</hi> in the Order and good Harmony of the ſeveral Faculties of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, with reſpect one to another, and in that Perfection which did Originally belong to each ſingle Faculty; The Image of God, I ſay in this reſpect, is miſerably defac'd in the Natural Man.</p>
            <p>As to the good Harmony of the ſeveral Faculties and Powers of Humane Nature, you have already ſeen how that is ſpoil'd. And as to the Perfection which ſhould be in every one of theſe ſeveral Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that in an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Man</hi> is very little. Alas in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, what is there now but Blindneſs and Darkneſs? What in his Will, but Stubborneſs and Perverſeneſs? What in his Affections, but Violence and Diſorder? And what in his Luſts and Appetites, but Senſuality and Irregularity? So ſadly is the whole Nature of the Unregenerate Man Corrupted, ſo that little or nothing of the Image of God does now remain in him.</p>
            <p>But, Laſtly, Above all, Man in his Unregenerate Nature is now miſerably Alter'd from what he was; in that all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, inſtead of Inclining towards, and Centring upon God and Heavenly Things, tend downwards towards the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Laſtly, the Tendency of all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both of Soul and Body, are towards the Creature.</note> As to the Appetites and Deſires in the Unregenerate, they are in a manner wholly ſenſual, and are hardly ever to be ſatisfy'd with what Gratifies the Senſes. The Affections alſo are wholly ſet upon Worldly Enjoyments, and the Will does alſo preferr and chuſe ſuch far before Spiritual Conſolations. And what is more, in the Unregenerate Man, the very <hi>Mind and Conſcience is defil'd,</hi> Tit. 1.15. <hi>And they who are after the Fleſh, do mind the things of the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.5. <hi>do mind Earthly Things,</hi> Phil. 3.14. Their whole Thoughts and Contrivances, their Meditations and Purpoſes are wholly upon thoſe poor and paltry Vanities of this World, and are altogether taken up <hi>in making Proviſions for the Fleſh,</hi> and their Hearts and Affections cling
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40806:122"/> cloſely and ſolely to the Earth. Hence it is ſaid of ſuch, that <hi>they live after the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.13. and that <hi>they walk after the Fleſh,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. they are ſo wholly Addicted to Fleſhly and Worldly Things. And thus you ſee what is meant by the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to conſider <hi>in what ſenſe, and how far we muſt Renounce the Fleſh.</hi> And, 1. The Fleſh muſt be Renounc'd by <hi>our being Renew'd in the whole Frame and Conſtitution of our Nature after the Image of God.</hi>

That is, we cannot without the Reſiſtance and Oppoſition of our Fleſhly Nature, act in Obedience to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Renewed Nature, ſo long as we are here on this ſide the Grave; but the moſt Holy Perſons that are, have their Graces allayed with a mixture of Sin and Corruption. The moſt Univerſal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not free from Ignorance and Error; the Will, which is moſt complying with the Commands of God, has ſometimes its contrary Velleities, or Wouldings; the Affections which are moſt Refin'd are ſometimes Inordinate and Earthly; ſo that every Faculty of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every Action we do, have ſome mixture of Sin and Frailty. In a word we cannot attain whilſt here on Earth, to theſe degrees of Perfection wherein we were firſt Created.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Image of God,</hi> which is reſtored to us in our Regeneration, tho' it have not the <hi>Perfection of Degrees,</hi> yet it muſt indiſpenſably have the <hi>Perfection of parts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It muſt be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Parts, tho not Degrees.</note> as Divines do diſtinguiſh; that is, we muſt have an Univerſal Inclination to all that is Holy, Juſt and Good, and an Univerſal Averſion from all Sin. And we muſt have our ſelves actually Adorn'd with all Divine Graces, and Holy Diſpoſitions; and
<pb facs="tcp:40806:122"/> we muſt actually forſake every known Sin: And then tho' ſomething of Humane Frailty will mix it ſelf in the Exerciſe of all our Vertues, yet through the Mercies of God the Father, in Chriſt his Son, it will be graciouſly diſpens'd withal: So that thus you ſee, when the whole Nature of Man in every part and faculty thereof is <hi>Chang'd, Repair'd,</hi> and <hi>Renew'd,</hi> according to the Happy Conſtitution and Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeveral Faculties, one to another, wherein Man was at firſt Created; and conſequently when the Divine Image which is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, is in ſome good meaſure reſtor'd; when thus we ſhall have <hi>put on the New Man,</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>partake of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. and <hi>be conformed ro the Image of his Son,</hi> Rom. 8.29. then can we be truly ſaid to Renounce the Fleſh.</p>

               </note> This is the true Property of the Regenerate Nature to be exalted above all Worldly Things, and to be carried out in Love and Affection towards God. <hi>The Soul,</hi> (ſays a Learned and Pious Author) <hi>is a more vigorous and puiſſant thing when it is once Reſtor'd to the poſſeſſion of its own Being, than to be bounded within a narrow Priſon of Senſual and Bodily Delights; but it will break forth with the greateſt Vehemence, and Aſcend upwards towards Immortality. For it is only true Religion that teaches and Enables Men to die to this World, and to all Earthly Things, and to riſe above the Sphere of Senſual and Earthly Pleaſures, which darken the Mind and blind it that it cannot enjoy the brightneſs of Divine Light; ſo that whereas the Fleſhly Mind never minds any thing but Fleſh, and never riſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Outward Matter, but always creeps up and down like Shadows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Surface of the Earth; and if it begin at any time to make any faint Eſſays upwards, it preſently finds it ſelf laden with a weight of Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which draws it down again; Holy and Religious Souls being toucht with an Inward Senſe of the Divine Goodneſs and Beauty, are mov'd ſwiftly after God, and as the Apoſtle expreſſes himſelf, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, they preſs towards the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus; that ſo they may attain to the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi>

            <p>IN order to the full Explication of theſe Words, <hi>the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, what.</note> Having already ſhew'd you, Firſt, what is meant by the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and in what ſenſe, and how far <hi>we muſt Renounce the Fleſh.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. I am now to give you in like manner the full Meaning and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the <hi>ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and to ſhew you in what ſenſe, and how far we are to Renounce them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as by the Fleſh is meant the whole Unregenerate Nature of Man, Soul as well as Body in its State of Corruption, and as it Acts contrary to the Holy Will and Spirit of God; ſo proportionably by the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, muſt be underſtood all the Faculties and Powers of this Corrupted Nature as they carry us out to commit Sin, as well the Faculties of the Soul, the Underſtanding and Will, as the Bodily Powers; <hi>viz.</hi> the Affections, Luſts and Appetites.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all of 'em in their own Nature, the Effects of God's Workmanſhip, and were pure as they came forth of his hands: But ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> they are wofully Corrupted, and there is none of theſe Faculties or Powers, either of Soul or Body, but may be called a <hi>ſinful Lust of the Fleſh.</hi> Every Faculty and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Soul and Body is properly enough term'd a <hi>Luſt,</hi> as it Craves and Deſires its Object. And they are all of 'em <hi>ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> juſt as the whole Unregenerate Nature was ſaid to be Fleſh; that is, either Firſt, as thoſe ſeveral Faculties of the Soul do move downwards from God and Heavenly Things, Immediately and Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately towards the Creatures: Or Secondly, as the Inferior and Bodily Powers, the Affections, Luſts, and Appetites, do diſorderly Rebel againſt the Superior Faculty of the Underſtanding and Reaſon, and do carry the Will into Slavery to 'em. I will take the whole Frame of this our depraved Nature in pieces, that ſo viewing that Corruption, which reſiding in every of the Faculties and Powers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, renders all of 'em ſo many <hi>ſinful Lusts of the Fleſh,</hi> we may be better able to Renounce each of thoſe ſinful and fleſhly Luſts.</p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:40806:123"/>
            <p>And Firſt, let us conſider that Corruption which Reſides in the Mind, and renders it Fleſhly, and conſequently the Motions even of the Intellectual part of our Nature, no better than <hi>ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſinful Luſts of the Fleſhly Mind, what.</note> And our Underſtanding, alas, which ſhould be full of Divine Knowledge, ſuch as may be a Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Paths, is in the Unregenerate Man full of Vanity, Ignorance of, and Prejudice againſt Divine Truths. The Unregenerate Man neither <hi>underſtands nor ſeeks after God,</hi> Rom. 3.11. <hi>He likes not to Retain God in his Knowledge,</hi> or to conſider any thing concerning him, <hi>but is vain in his Imaginations, having his fooliſh heart darkned,</hi> Rom. 1.21, 28.

And hence it comes to paſs, that whereas the great and proper Appetite of the Mind is after Knowledge, an Appetite which God hath put into the Soul of Man, and ſo a thing Beautiful and Good: This very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Knowledge becomes a ſinful Luſt of the Fleſhly Mind in ſeveral Caſes, particularly in theſe following; <hi>viz.</hi> when either we miſplace our Deſires of Knowledge upon wrong Objects, or when we do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately ſtudy to be exquiſitely skill'd in Humane, tho' Lawful Arts and Sciences, to the Neglect and Contempt of Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And Laſtly, when out of Pride, Prejudice, and contradiction to all ſacred Truths, we ſet up our own Fleſhly Imaginations and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings againſt the Spiritual Notions that are dictated to us. And accordingly ſuch our Appetites or Deſires, even of Knowledge it ſelf, muſt be Renounced, as ſo many ſinful Luſts of a Fleſhly Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt we muſt Renounce the Deſires of Knowing wrong Objects;</hi> that is, we muſt not Gratifie, but Mortifie our Deſires of Knowing ſuch Things, which are either <hi>Hurtful to be known,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1:</hi> When we are curious to know Things which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hurtful to be Known,</note> or are not <hi>proper for Man to know.</hi> Now as to this we are to conſider, that there is a certain Diſtemper of Mind, called Curioſity, which as it is of like Nature, ſo it is of full as hurtful and Miſchievous Effects to the Mind, as that Diſtemper is to the Body, which ſtirs up Perſons to eat Chalk, or Coals, or Traſh, or whatever affords either none at all, or a very ill Nouriſhment: Such is the Curioſity of Knowing Evil, which was the thing that ruin'd our firſt Parents, and afterwards <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſince him, many other Perſons: Such are they who have a great Deſire to taſte thoſe Pleaſures which are in Sin, and by Taſting of 'em their Minds are defil'd, and their Morals Corrupted, and it is ſeldom that they do ever after return to have a right Judgment of Good or Evil. Thus hurtful is the Knowledge of ſome things, ſo that it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be Ignorant thereof, than to know 'em.</p>
            <p>Again there are others, whoſe Curioſity gives 'em a ſtrange Itch <hi>to know Hidden Things, ſuch as are not proper for Man to know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or not proper for Man to know.</note> as the Decrees of Predeſtination, and the Counſels of God's Will, which is the Ark that no Mortal Eye ought to look into. And many are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Inquiſitive to learn the Future Events of Kingdoms and States, and of their own and others private Fortunes. And therefore it is, that they are ſo apt to give heed to every pretended Prophecy; and thô few are ſo very wicked, as to Conſult Evil Spirits themſelves by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arts, yet Multitudes will make no ſcruple to Reſort to Fortune-tellers and Conjurers; and thoſe that do conſult 'em, or are reputed
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40806:124"/> to do, thô it be an Impiety ſo ſeverely threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.11, 12. But all Curious Enquiries whatever into the Secrets of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are to be Renounc'd by us Chriſtians, as being the Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only of a ſinful Curioſity. <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are Reveal'd, unto us and our Children for ever, that we may do all the words of his Law,</hi> Deut. 29.29.</p>

We muſt Renounce that as a ſinful Luſt of the Fleſhly Mind, which improportionably to the true worth of things, is more deſirous to furniſh it ſelf with the Knowledge of what concerns only this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, than with the Knowledge of thoſe Divine Truths, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to Life Everlaſting. Now <hi>this is Life Eternal,</hi> or that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which leadeth and directs us to Life Eternal, <hi>That we know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.3. But alas, ſuch is the Folly of the Carnally and Worldly wiſe, that moſt Perſons do neglect the Knowledge of God, and the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if it were little worth, when certainly in the end there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſtand us in that ſtead as this ſort of Knowledge. Some there are whoſe whole ſearch is for the Cauſes and Cures of Bodily Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and yet alas all is but Gueſs and Conjecture, and an ordinary Malady, not very ſeldom, baffles the moſt Learned Phyſician, and he ſits down heavy in Diſgrace and Diſappointment. But the Knowledge of God and Religion, if duly apply'd, never fails to Cure the Soul of all its Infirmities, nor will it fail to fill the Mind with the Sweeteſt Comforts and Satisfactions. Others you ſhall have who deſire and care for nothing more than good Skill in the Laws of their Countrey, whereby they may raiſe themſelves good Eſtates in this World; but alas, ſuch Knowledge can only ſerve a preſent Intereſt; but by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Chriſtianity we may be able to <hi>provide our ſelves Bags that wax not old, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Some are wholly bent upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and Trade, but when the moſt Skilful Pilot ſhall ſplit upon the Rocks, or be foundred in the Sands, he who has Heaven in his Eye may ſteer his Courſe without danger through the rougheſt Billows of Adverſe Fortune. And others there are who ſeem to aim at no higher Knowledge, than how to Till their Land, and feed their Cattle, and when after all the Crop fails the moſt painful Husbandman, he who knows the Laws of Chriſtianity need not fear a joyful and a plentiful Harveſt; ſo excellent and uſeful is Divine Knowledge above all other Arts and Sciences. Not that I would caſt a Diſparagement upon them; they are the Gift of God, and uſeful in their kind; but the Knowledge of our Chriſtian Religion, as it ſerves to nobler and better Purpoſes, ſo ought it to be prefer'd to any other,<note place="margin">The Knowledge of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, as it ſerves to nobler Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo ought it to be prefer'd to any other.</note> and moſt ſtudy'd by every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And hence therefore does St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he comes at any time to ſpeak of Divine Knowledge, not only barely enjoyn the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it, as of other Vertues, but does moreover add Prayers and Supplications to God to endow 'em therewith, and to increaſe 'em therein. <hi>We do not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that ye might be filled with the Knowledge of his Will in all Wiſdom and Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that ye might walk worthy of the Lord in all pleaſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in the Knowledge of God,</hi> Col. 1.9, 10. And again, <hi>I ceaſe not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>making mention of you always in my Prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40806:124"/> in the Knowledge of him,</hi> Eph. 1.16, 17. So that tho to be excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well skill'd in any Art or Science whatſoever, which terminates only in the Conveniencies of this Life, be not only Lawful, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, yet it is a Profaneneſs fit to be Renounc'd by every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to prefer ſuch to Divine Knowledge, and to apply your Mind wholly to the attaining of ſuch Skill, to the Neglect of thoſe Great and Important Truths, the Knowledge of which is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Everlaſting Happineſs. And therefore let your Profeſſion and Calling be what it will, you muſt make it your firſt Care and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to know the Nature and Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">The Neceſſary Points of Chriſtian Knowledge.</note> how that it is a Body of the moſt Excellent Principles and Laws, all of 'em tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to render you Holy and Good Livers, and then to make you to depend upon the Mediation of Chriſt with his Father, for his Acceptance thereof to your Juſtification. You muſt alſo next make it more your Study to underſtand throughly the Covenant of Grace, than the Nature and Obligation of any Humane Covenants or Contracts, whatſoever. And ſince we muſt build our hopes upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of particular Articles, and as exactly as poſſible ſquare our Lives according to each ſingle Condition of the Covenant of Grace, there can be nothing of more concernment to every Chriſtian, <hi>Lay</hi> as well as <hi>Clergy,</hi> than throughly to underſtand, both the Meaning and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of every Doctrine of Faith, and the Nature and Extent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian Duty. And laſtly, Since a good End can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd without the Knowledge and Uſe of due and proper means, the Nature therefore and Uſe of Prayer, and the Nature and End of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments muſt be a moſt neceſſary part of Chriſtian Knowledge. So much muſt our Appetities after Knowledge in the moſt Excellent of Humane Arts and Science be Renounc'd, in compariſon of our Deſires after a competent Meaſure of Divine Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Laſtly, above all we muſt Renounce</hi> that prevailing Appetite in ſuch as are of moſt Depraved and Corrupt Minds, <hi>viz. The ſetting up their own Imaginations and Fleſhly Reaſonings againſt thoſe Spiritual Notions, and thoſe more Myſterious Articles of Faith, which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us in the Scripture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> When out of Pride, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all Sacred Truths, we ſet up our own Carnal Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and Fleſhly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings againſt thoſe Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Notions, and thoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith, which are deliver'd to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> In the more depraved Nature of ſome Men, there is a great deal of Untowardneſs and Difficulty to ſubmit to the Sacred Truths Revealed to us by Chriſt in the Goſpel, as to Matters of Faith, or ſuch Articles as are neceſſary to be believ'd: One that is conceited of his own Wiſdom, ſtrength of Parts, or Improvement in Knowledge, will not ſubmit his Reaſon to entertain Notions which he cannot <hi>Comprehend</hi> and Penetrate. <hi>The Carnal Mind which is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. will diſdain to have his Underſtanding baffl'd or puzzl'd with Sublime Myſteries of Faith, he will quarrel at any thing too high for his Wit to reach, or too Knotty for him to unlooſe. How can theſe things be? What Reaſon can there be for this? I cannot ſee how this can be true. This Point is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And perhaps he finds fault with the whole Body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, either becauſe ſome things are obſcure to him, or the Phraſe is not queint and fine enough. Thus the Carnal Mind treateth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Faith, and the Word of God.</p>
            <p>But far be it from Chriſtians thus to indulge their own Carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and Self-Conceits, in oppoſition to what God has Reveal'd to us, as neceſſary to be Believ'd by us. For certainly the Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40806:125"/> both knows what is fitteſt to be taught and reveal'd to us, and in what Manner and Method he had beſt to expreſs himſelf. Thoſe that did thus proudly deſpiſe the Wiſdom of God, meaſuring it according to their own Talent of Wit and Underſtanding, did at firſt, and do to this Day moſt fatally miſcarry; for it is written, 1 Cor. 1.19. <hi>I will deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and will bring to nothing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Prudent.</hi> But our Duty is to ſubmit our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Almighty God to be Inlightn'd by his Infinite Wiſdom, <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. There is a great deal of Vertue and Grace in an Obedient Underſtanding, and therefore to the Diſciples who were ſo diſpos'd, <hi>To them it was given</hi> as our Saviour tells us, Matth. 13.11. <hi>To underſtand the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to them</hi> who are not prepar'd with an humble Mind, <hi>it is not given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this an hard Impoſition upon Mankind, to oblige 'em to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is above our Reaſon to Comprehend. It is ſufficient that the Holy Scriptures which do deliver ſuch Articles of Faith, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be Believ'd, are ſufficiently witneſſed to be Divine Revelations; and that there is nothing contain'd in the Articles or Myſteries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which is contrary or contradictory to that Reaſon which God has given to Man. But that there ſhould be any thing in an Article of Faith, which, though it be above our Reaſon to Comprehend, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this its State of weakneſs) muſt yet be Believ'd, will not ſeem hard, if we conſider, that there are many Appearances, even in Nature it ſelf, which no Man has been yet found who could give a tolerable account for; and yet the truth of their being ſo and ſo, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be call'd in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">This Humour of oppoſing Reaſon to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from mere Pride.</note>In ſhort, this Humour of oppoſing our own Fleſhly Reaſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Divine Revelations which we cannot now in this State of Imperfection, ſo fully Comprehend, proceeds meerly from the Pride of thoſe Men, who diſdaining to own the Decays of our Reaſon, as well as of other the Powers of the Soul, ever ſince the Fall, (which every Modeſt Man's Experience does make him too ſenſible of in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inſtances) do over-value their Talent of Wit, far beyond what they ought: And this therefore being ſuch a proud <hi>Luciferian</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it ought to be <hi>Renounc'd,</hi> as the moſt Impious of all the <hi>Sinful Luſts of the Fleſhly Mind.</hi> And let this ſuffice to be ſpoke concerning our Renouncing of the Sinful Luſts of that ſort.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">The Corrupt Will, what and how to be Renounc'd.</note>2. <hi>Let us next conſider the WILL, and the Innate Corruption which Reſiding in that Faculty renders it Fleſhly, and tending in all its Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards the Creature, and ſo the proper Matter of the Chriſtians Renuntiation.</hi> 
               <q>And as to this Faculty we are to conſider, how that God gave to Man a Righteous Law, which was to be the Rule of his Will; and while it was conformable to this, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Will of God, and conſequently beautiful and regular; but inſtead thereof, there is now <hi>a Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. And this Law ſubdues the Law of the Mind, and brings the Soul <hi>into Captivity to the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.23. And the Will being thus Captivated, is made Carnal, and filled with Enmity againſt God, and that Law which he once plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40806:125"/> in us to be the Rule of our Will; ſo that it is not <hi>ſubject to the Law of God; neither indeed can be,</hi> whilſt we remain unregenerate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</q> But in its corrupt State being always Averſe to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of God's Laws and Right Reaſon, it perverſly chuſes thoſe things which pleaſe only the Senſes, and ſo becomes, in the moſt proper and immediate Senſe of the Word, a Sinful and <hi>Fleſhly Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as obſtinately bent, as the Corrupt Will is found to be, againſt complying with the Laws of God, which would guide our Souls upwards, we muſt bring our ſelves to that Habit of Self-denial, ſo as readily to ſubmit our Wills to God's Laws, to be Govern'd by 'em; the reaſon is, we are not our own, and therefore our own depraved Wills ought not to bear Rule in us, but we are God's Creatures, and his Subjects and Servants, and therefore his All-wiſe Will and Pleaſure ſhould be the Rule and Meaſure of, and preſide over all our Actions. And this it muſt do in the moſt difficult Caſes, when his Laws ſeem moſt to thwart our Reaſon, and his Diſpenſations ſeem moſt hard and ſevere. Thus did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the Father of the Faithful,</hi> when God commanded him even to <hi>ſlay his only Son</hi> Iſaac, he readily obey'd, he did not ſtand to diſpute the caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.10. And thus did <hi>Job</hi> in reference to the Diſpenſations of God's Providence, when he was ſtript naked of his vaſt Poſſeſſions, and even of his dear Children; he even then bleſt God for it, (kiſſing as it were the Rod that ſtroke him.) <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1.21.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Affections in the Carnal Man do ſadly degenerate into what may too properly be call'd the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> The Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, what, and how to be Renounc'd.</note> Our Paſſions and Affections are indeed in themſelves of ſingular uſe to the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Natures. They are the Wings of the Soul to carry it forth with eagerneſs in the purſuit of that which is good, and with Averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Flight from that which is Evil. They are variouſly numbred up, but the Maſter Affections are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> which when they are rightly govern'd, all the reſt are ſo too; but when they are miſplac'd and out of order, ſo in the ſame proportion are all the others. And accordingly, whereas then it is, that our Love is rightly fix'd; 1. <hi>When we place it upon a proper Object:</hi> And, 2. <hi>When we ſteer towards the Thing we Love, with Deſires proportionable to the Good that is in the Object,</hi> that is, <q>When the beſt and greateſt Things are purſu'd with our Chiefeſt Paſſions, middle Things with a leſs, and the loweſt with the least;</q> So it is, that ſo long as a Perſon remains Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he either firſt places his Love upon that which he ſhould Hate, which is the wrong Object, as upon ſinful Profits and Pleaſures; or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he loves Things of an Indifferent Nature, ſuch as are Earthly Things, with an over Intenſe Affection, beyond their true Worth and Value. And ſo on the contrary, as to Hatred, the Carnal Mind hates that which he ſhould love, <hi>Viz.</hi> God and Vertue, The <hi>Carnal Mind is Enmity against God, nor is it Subject to the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Or elſe he hates ſome Things as the chiefeſt of all Evils, <hi>viz.</hi> Sufferings and Afflictions, when indeed they are of that Nature, that upon due Conſideration a Man ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>That it is good for him, that he has been Afflicted.</hi> And accordingly when our Affections of either kind, are either <hi>miſplac'd upon wrong Objects,</hi> or are <hi>diſproportionate to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40806:126"/> the true worth and Evil</hi> that is in thoſe Objects, towards which it is lawful to be well or evilly Affected in Moderate Degrees. In either of theſe caſes, I ſay, our Affections ſhall become Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and are neceſſary to be Renounced by us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> As they are Miſplac't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note>
               <hi>And</hi> 1. <hi>Thoſe Affections of Love and Hatred muſt be utterly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, which we ſhall find our ſelves to have miſplac't upon wrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> that is, inſtead of Loving, we muſt utterly Hate and Abhor all Sin and Sinful Pleaſures: So the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 97.10. <hi>Ye that Love the Lord, hate Evil.</hi> Now Sin is the greateſt Evil in the World, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt directly contrary to the Holy Nature and Will of God; and it is the Cauſe of all the Evils which befal us, and therefore to take pleaſure in Sin is ſo perverſe a thing, that ſo long as any Perſon remains thus wickedly Diſpos'd, he is an Enemy of God, and no better than a <hi>Child of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3.10. Thus muſt we not miſplace our Love upon that greateſt of all Evils, which is Sin.</p>
            <p>And <hi>ſo</hi> 2. <hi>Inſtead of Hating God and Vertue, againſt whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate are at Enmity, we muſt Entirely and Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately Love both,</hi> which is ſo plain and palpable a Truth, as needs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof nor Enlargement. And thus we are to Renounce the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Love and Hatred, whenever they are miſplac'd upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Objects.</p>

            <p n="1">1ſt.

Nay, and we muſt ſo Love him, as even to <hi>Hate</hi> all others, the Neareſt and Deareſt Relations in compariſon of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. So far muſt we Renounce our Affections of Love, as it is any wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the thing Beloved, as it is too violently ſet upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and worldly Goods, and too cold towards God and Heavenly Things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And on the contrary we muſt alſo Renounce that other Affection of Hatred, as it is Diſproportionate to the Evil, which is to be Hated.</hi> There may be juſt occaſion of Anger towards a Perſon, and of Hatred of his ways, but we muſt not let thoſe Paſſions ſo far exceed their due Bounds, as to Degenerate into Wrath and Malice. <hi>Let all Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour be put away from you with all Malice; And be ye Kind one to another, Tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.31, 32.<note place="margin">

            <p>And indeed this Renouncing of theſe Fleſhly <hi>Luſts of Concupiſcence,</hi> is perhaps what the Compoſers of our Catechiſm (as taking the Form of Renuntiation from the Ancient Baptiſmal Vow) did particularly intend; for as the Gentiles did ſcarcely make any account of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor think it an Irregularity and Vice, ſo the Scripture, and the firſt Chriſtians, did particularly lay it upon all that ſhould take upon 'em the Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, to <hi>Renounce</hi> thoſe kind of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts. <hi>But Fornication and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh Saints; for this know you, that no Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Perſon hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Eph. 5.4, 5.

All Men are not alike Addicted to Sin; but according as their Temper and Inclinations do differ, accordingly are they more or leſs given, ſome to one Vice, ſome to another. Thus ſome are Naturally High-minded, and theſe diſdaining to Think in the common Road, or to ſubmit their Judgments to commonly receiv'd Opinions, are always ſtarting new Notions, and broaching New <hi>Hereſies.</hi> Some again will be Orthodox enough in their Opinions; but being Perſons of warm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and Sanguine Complexions, they cannot help it they'll ſay, their being overcome by the Pleaſures of Senſe. The whole Herd of Unregenerate Sinners are not made up of ſuch as are all over wicked. But ſome are more particularly in their own Nature addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Covetous, ſome to Revenge, and others to Luſt, and the like. And then when theſe their Natural Diſpoſitions are ſtrengthen'd (as is uſual) by long Accuſtom'd Habits of Indulgence to ſome ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexional Vices; it becomes a very difficult Work utterly to <hi>Renounce</hi> ſuch Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>But however difficult it is,<note place="margin">There muſt be no one Fleſhly Luſt ſuffer'd to Reign in us.</note> there muſt be no <hi>Indulgence</hi> to any one Fleſhly Luſt, nor muſt there be any Vitious Inclination ſuffer'd to Reign in us; for <hi>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> Rom. 1.18.

            <p>And indeed our Buſineſs is particularly to ſet our ſelves in oppoſition to thoſe Luſts,<note place="margin">Our buſineſs is particularly to oppoſe Luſts of Temper and Conſtitution.</note> which ariſe from our particular Temper and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and to ſubdue them; And alſo to break off thoſe Habits whereby theſe Natural Inclinations and proneneſs to ſome particular Sins have grown ſtrong upon us.

And becauſe they find St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, (a Regenerate Perſon no doubt) owning that <hi>he found a Law, that when he would do good,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40806:128"/> evil was preſent with him, and that he delighted in the Law of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inward Man; but that he ſaw another Law in his Members, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin which was in his Members; ſo that with the Mind he did ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.21, 22, 23, 25. Becauſe, I ſay, they find even St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing himſelf, as they think, as unable to Reſiſt the Temptations of Fleſhly Luſts; and that all that he was able to do, was in his Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to diſapprove of that which the prevailing power of Luſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, forc'd him to commit; They do therefore conclude, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be with <hi>Reluctance,</hi> and ſome Counter-Strivings againſt their Luſts, that they do yield thereto; that they are in a Regenerate State, however, tho in the Iſſue they do comply therewith; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is not of ſuch neceſſity to Renounce <hi>ALL,</hi> but that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Appetites may be Indulg'd, what the Mind and Reaſon do ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhly Refuſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In ſhort therefore, and to draw towards a Concluſion, we muſt not content our ſelves in this great Work of <hi>Renouncing ALL the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> that we have our Minds enlightned, ſo as to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40806:128"/> know what we ought to do, whilſt our Affections and bodily Powers do remain Rebellious againſt the Dictates of our Minds and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But we muſt have our whole Natures poſſeſs'd with an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an Antipathy from the very Heart, againſt all Sin; and we muſt have both the Mind, Will and Affections, nay, the very Luſts and Appetites fully bent againſt it. And we muſt have, on the contrary, a hearty Love and Diſpoſition to all Vertue, wrought in all the ſame Faculties both of Soul and Body. VVe muſt be <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and put on the New Man, which after God is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.23, 24.</p>
            <p>And when a Perſon is thus inwardly Chang'd throughout, in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, it is then only that he can be truly ſaid to be <hi>a New Creature, a New Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this, indeed,<note place="margin">This the hard Part.</note> to become thus Renew'd in the Spirit of our Minds, ſo as to have the Heart and Affections ſet againſt Sin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſures, as well as the Mind Convinc'd of the Evil of 'em, is the hard Work. This is certain, that it is not poſſible for any Man to work ſo great a Change in his Nature, of himſelf, but it is the Spirit of God that muſt Aſſiſt wonderfully in the doing of it. And, indeed,</p>
            <p>That we may be ſaid ſincerely and throughly to <hi>Renounce the Fleſh, and ALL its ſinful Luſts;</hi> that Renovation of our Corrupted Nature, wherein this Renuntiation does conſiſt, muſt be ſuch as is wrought in us by the Spirit and Grace of God. This I ſay, becauſe it is very poſſible for a Man to be Chang'd from ſome ſenſual Courſes to an utter hatred thereof, and yet remain in God's Eyes a <hi>Carnal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate</hi> Man; and the reaſon is, becauſe his Change proceeds not from any Inward Vital Principle of Vertue, but from ſome prudential Methods in the management of his Pleaſures, as ſome the moſt ſenſual Epicures, that live, ſhall become at length temperate and ſober, becauſe their Conſtitutions will not bear a Debauch; but as the Spirit of God had nothing to do in the Change, ſo in their Hearts and Minds they remain ſtill to be ſenſual. And others again you ſhall meet, who have a full Conviction in their Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, through the preaching of the Word, of the Evil of Sin, and yet in their Affectiens they Love it, and their Luſts and Appetites Rebelling againſt the Reaſon of their Mind, will have it, and their Wills do finally chuſe it; ſo that theſe Perſons <hi>with the Mind do ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in that much miſtaken Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. does repreſent, (as was now ſhew'd you) the Caſe of the Carnal Jew, abiding only under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Law. But where the Spirit of God works the Change, that Perſon is <hi>Sanctify'd wholly, and the whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body will be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. So that ſuch a Perſon ſhall effectually Renounce the Fleſh, and All its ſinful Luſts, both of the Inward, and of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, as we will <hi>draw nigh to God, and have him draw nigh to us, we muſt cleanſe our hands, and purifie our hearts, and not be double-minded,</hi> James 4.8. We muſt, through the help of his Grace, <hi>Cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40806:129"/> Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. We muſt be always, I ſay, in the perfecting of (one degree after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) our Holineſs, and that Image of God which we loſt by our Fall; for the ſubduing of All our Luſts, muſt be the Work of Time; and it is not of a ſudden, that we can get an intire Conqueſt over 'em ALL. But if in our Strivings againſt 'em, we find our ſelves ſtill more and more to get ground upon 'em, we are in a hopeful Condition. In a Word therefore, <hi>Brethren, we are Debtors, not to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh; for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if through the Spirit ye do Mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live; for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 12.13, 14.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Reaſon of having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd ſo much upon this one Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>And ſo I have at length done with this no leſs Important, than Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Subject, the <hi>Renouncing of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh.</hi> It may ſeem indeed, as if I have been too long upon the Explication of one ſingle Article of our Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Renouncing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and All the Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> But if it be conſidered, that half the Buſineſs of our Chriſtian Religion is performed in Reſiſting the Enemies of our Salvation, it will not be a Matter of blame that I have been ſo long upon this Point, eſpecially in Inſtructing of Youth about it, who ought to be very well fore-arm'd in order to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming off Conquerors. The truth of it is, this Renouncing of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; that is, the Reſiſting, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of all their Numerous Hoſt of Temptations, is the Chriſtian's Warfare and great Work. For as the Holy Scriptures do in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Texts Repreſent our State as a State of Warfare. (<hi>Fight the good Fight of Faith, lay hold on Eternal Life; for hereunto ye have been called before many Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12. That is, we Liſted our ſelves in this Warfare at our Baptiſm, in the Preſence of the Church of Chriſt) As our State, I ſay, is a State of Warfare againſt all theſe Spiritual Enemies; ſo it does infinitely concern all of us to know, as far as is poſſible, All their Arts and Stratagems to deceive us; and this, I hope, will be a ſufficient Apology, that I have been ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably long, to what I have, and ſhall be upon other Heads, in ſhewing you what it is, and how far you muſt <hi>Renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>

            <p>HAving largely Explain'd the firſt Condition of Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhew'd you, what I conceive is meant by <hi>Renouncing the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh;</hi> I come now to do the like, as to the Second Condition upon which we are to expect to be Juſtify'd, to have our Sins Pardon'd, and eternal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conferr'd upon us; and which we have alſo Covenanted with God to do, and that is, that <hi>we Believe all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</hi> In order to the Explication of which Point,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I will declare to you the General Nature of thoſe ARTICLES, or Chriſtian Truths, which are to be believed.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>I will ſhew you how we muſt Believe ALL the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that I am to declare to you ſomething in general,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Articles of Chriſtian Faith, of what Nature.</note> 
               <hi>concerning the Nature of thoſe ARTICLES, or Chriſtian Truths, which are to be Believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Bible, both Old and New Teſtament, is the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a Chriſtians Faith;<note place="margin">The whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Object of a Chriſtian's Faith, both</note> and whatever we find therein Recorded, or deliver'd down to us, we are to believe, as a Divine, Certain, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth, becauſe all things therein contain'd, are the Word of him who will not, who cannot Lie, who neither can be deceiv'd himſelf, nor will he deceive others.</p>
            <p>As to the Old Teſtament and the<note place="margin">the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the</note> Writings of the Prophets, <hi>Jehoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> in a Solemn Aſſembly of the whole People, upon a Solemn Faſt-day, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. Proclaimed unto them, <hi>ſtood up and ſaid, Hear me O Judah, and Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you be Eſtabliſhed; believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye Proſper.</hi> And let the Declarations of God Recorded therein be of what Nature they will, the Truth of them is by no means to be called in doubt; <hi>If you will not Believe, ſurely ye ſhall not be Eſtabliſh'd,</hi> Iſa. 7.9.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe as to the New Teſtament;<note place="margin">New.</note> Our Saviour upon his entrance to preach the Goſpel, did in the firſt place require of all Men
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40806:130"/> to Believe it. <hi>Jeſus came into Galilee, preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God, and ſaying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; Repent ye and Believe the Goſpel,</hi> Mark 1.14, 15. And when he was alſo leaving the World, and Commiſſion'd his Diſciples <hi>to go into all the World, and to preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> He declar'd, that <hi>he that Believeth ſhall he Saved, but he that Believeth not ſhall be Damn'd,</hi> Mark 16.15, 16. So that both the Old and New Teſtament, and every part and parcel of Scripture therein contain'd, is firmly to be Believ'd, as the Divine, Certain, and Infallible Truth of God.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon thereof, as to the Old Teſtament, is <hi>becauſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy came not in Old time by the Will of Man; but Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. And we are alſo firmly to Believe all the parts both of Old and New indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, becauſe <hi>all Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. All the parts of it are the Dictates and Word of God himſelf, and are more or leſs Uſeful to our Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Improvement in Divine Knowledge, Faith, and Practice. And therefore all Ranks and Degrees of Men, and of every Age, Young as well as Old, ought diligently to Study, and firmly to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Holy Scriptures. The <hi>Bereans</hi> did ſo, and they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the more Honourable for ſo doing. The <hi>Bereans were more Noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they Received, or Believed the Word with all readineſs of Mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily,</hi> Act. 17.11. And it is Recorded to the Immortal Honour of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.15. <hi>that from a Child he had known the Scriptures, which were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but tho' all Scripture, as being the Infallible Word of him, who neither can be deceived himſelf, nor will deceive others, does Challenge the Belief of every Chriſtian; yet among the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Truths of various Kinds deliver'd in the Scriptures, ſome are of far greater Importance and <hi>Concernment</hi> to us than others,<note place="margin">Some Truths Revealed in Scripture of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and Concernment to us, than others.</note> becauſe they do more immediately and directly tend to give us due and worthy Apprehenſions of God, and to Inſtruct us in the only ſure Method of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. There are ſome Principal Doctrines of Chriſtianity which are in their own Nature apt to have a greater Influence upon our Lives, and more powerfully to reſtrain us from a courſe of Sin, and to unite us to the Practice of Vertue and Holineſs, than others; and when they have done this, to ſend us to God the Father to ſeek for Acceptance meerly through Chriſt his Son. And upon theſe, and the like accounts, therefore ſuch Truths as theſe are more particularly neceſſary to be Believed by us, in order to our Juſtification before God, and to our Salvation in the other World; and are therefore called the <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> being a Summary and Collection of ſuch Doctrines out of the Holy Scriptures, as are of a more <hi>Concerning</hi> Nature than the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And muſt therefore be diſtinctly Known, and explicitely Believed.</note>All thoſe other Truths, of what Nature ſoever, contained in the Holy Scriptures, are indeed neceſſary alſo to be Believed, at leaſtwiſe <hi>Implicitely;</hi> that is, we are to be poſſeſs'd with a General Perſwaſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40806:130"/> that they are all certainly true, becauſe God has Reveal'd them as ſuch. But theſe latter which we call the <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> muſt be poſitively and <hi>Explicitely Believed,</hi> that is, we muſt throughly underſtand 'em, and be aſſuredly and diſtinctly perſwaded of each ſingle Truth contained in 'em, as without which underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſwaſion, a Good and Chriſtian Life will not be wrought in us, nor a reliance on God's Merits in Chriſt for the acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Created in our Souls.</p>
            <p>Such, for inſtance, is the Belief that there is a God;<note place="margin">Some Inſtances of ſuch Truths.</note> for this is the very firſt Principle of all Religion, and muſt neceſſarily make us ſtand in awe, and fear of offending him, if we throughly believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it: Such is the Belief, that he is our Father who <hi>Created us and all the World;</hi> for this will make us love him who gave us our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſuch again is the Belief, that he Exerciſes a juſt and a wiſe Providence in the Government of the World; for this will make us ſubmit our ſelves to all his Diſpenſations, as being the Appointments of one who knows better than our ſelves what is beſt for us.</p>
            <p>And to inſtance alſo in ſome which are the Truths purely of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion; Such is the Belief, that the Son of God came down from Heaven to ſuffer Death for us, to Redeem us from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; for this, as it ſhews us how Odious a thing Sin is, when nothing leſs could ſatisfie God's Juſtice againſt it, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of the Son of God; and conſequently, does extreamly tend to create in our Hearts an utter hatred to all Sin; So hereby we are taught, that <hi>Christ has made a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And ſuch, laſtly, is the Belief (for I need not now ſtand to mention every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) that all our Bodies ſhall riſe again at the General Reſurrection; that then we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, to Receive a Juſt Sentence for <hi>whatever we have done in the Body, whether it be good or bad;</hi> for this will make us careful how to lead our Lives ſo in this World, that we may not be Condemned in the next.</p>
            <p>Theſe now are ſome of thoſe <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and are ſuch Divine Truths, as are more particularly neceſſary to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by us, as containing in them the greateſt reaſon in the World to reſtrain us from all manner of Sin, and to encourage us in the Practice of all Religious Duties. And yet are Doctrines withal of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary force to remove all conceit out of our Minds concerning our own Merits, and to make us rely ſolely upon God's Mercies in Chriſt, for the Acceptance of our moſt Holy Performances. And let this ſuffice, as to the firſt thing propoſed, which was to declare unto you ſomething in general, of the Nature of the Objects, or of thoſe Truths to be Believed <hi>the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And now,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I will alſo ſhew you what it is to BELIEVE theſe Truths, ſo as to make us capable of Life and Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be ask'd how we muſt Believe theſe things,<note place="margin">What it is to Believe thoſe Truths ſo as to make us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> why <hi>we muſt be ſo throughly and firmly perſwaded of their undoubted Truth, as to be accordingly Influenced</hi> (as I have now ſaid) <hi>by the Belief thereof, to the Practice of Good Works, and then to betake our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt to Interceed with the Father, for their Gracious Acceptance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40806:131"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our Belief thereof muſt be Operative and Practical.</note>I ſay, <hi>our Faith muſt be ſuch, as does Influence us to a Good Life;</hi> for ſuch is the Faith that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us is now required in the Chriſtian Religion in order to Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love:</hi> Some render the words, and that more rightly, <hi>Faith that is perfected by Love;</hi> which does more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignifie the Apoſtles meaning, that that Faith which will ſave us, muſt be ſuch which is perfected by the addition of thoſe Duties which we owe to God and our Neighbour. And St. <hi>James</hi> does with great Induſtry ſhew, that the Chriſtian Faith, which has the promiſe of Juſtification and Salvation, is a <hi>Powerful, Practical Belief,</hi> and that none other has any Promiſe. <hi>What,</hi> ſays St. <hi>James,</hi> 2.14. <hi>doth it profit my Brethren, tho' a Man ſaith, he hath Faith, and hath not Works, can Faith ſave him? Faith, if it have not Works, is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone,</hi> v. 17. and is no more than what the Devils have; <hi>for the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> v. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Such was the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of all the Saints.</note>And the Faith, indeed, for which the Holy Patriarchs and Saints were renowned of Old, and are now ſo highly Rewarded in Heaven, was a <hi>Powerful, Practical,</hi> and Working Faith indeed, which exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the higheſt and the hardeſt Acts of Obedience, that it was poſſible for Men to perform. Thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18. we read, <hi>that by Faith, Abraham, when he was tryed, offered up Iſaac; and he that had received the Promiſes offered up his only begotten Son,</hi> and he a Son too in whom God had promiſed him great Bleſſings; And yet, at God's Command, he readily Obeyed, believing that God would be as good as his promiſe to him, tho' it was by raiſing him again from the Dead. <hi>By Faith, Moſes, when he was come to Years, refuſed to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter, chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt; for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> v. 24, 25, 26. It was a great temptation to <hi>Moſes</hi> to be made a Prince, if he pleaſed, in which Eſtate he might enjoy the higheſt Pleaſures this World could afford; but he Believing, that God would infinitely reward him for his Self-denial, in refuſing ſuch Worldly Honours and Pleaſures, choſe rather to be one of thoſe mean Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted People, the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By Faith, thouſands of Bleſſed Saints before us, <hi>endured tryals of cruel Mockings and Scourgings, yea, moreover, of Bonds and Impriſonments; they were Stoned, they were Sawn aſunder, were Tempted, were Slain with the Sword, they wandred about in Sheep-skins, and in Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, (of whom the world was not worthy) they wandred in Deſarts, and in Mountains, and in Dens, and in Caves of the Earth,</hi> Heb. 11.35, 36, 37, 38. They were terrible Sufferings which the Servants of God in former times have been put to undergo; but as dreadful as they were, being ſupported with a firm belief, that they ſhould be infinitely recompenced for their Sufferings and Loſſes, they thereupon cheerfully underwent the ſevereſt, that the Wit or Malice of Men or Devils could invent or inflict upon 'em. Such a powerful, practical, working Faith indeed, was that for which the Holy Patriarchs and Saints were of Old renowned, and are now rewarded in Heaven: A Faith, I ſay, which excited them to the higheſt and hardeſt Acts
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40806:131"/> of Obedience, that it was poſſible for Men to perform. And ſuch a Powerful, Practical, Active and Working Principle is Faith, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the things Believed are of great Importance or <hi>Concernment</hi> to us.<note place="margin">And ſuch an Operative and Practical Principle is Faith, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Things belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved are of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us.</note> 
               <q>Some things indeed, as an Excellent Perſon does well obſerve, are of ſuch a Nature, that the Belief or Knowledge of 'em goes no farther, but reſts in it ſelf, as the Knowledge or Belief of bare Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Truths, that do not at all <hi>Concern</hi> us; but ſome things again are of ſuch a Nature, as being once firmly and truly believed, and known, carry a Man out to action.</q> Thus, for Example; If you ſhould hear another threaten'd, that he ſhould certainly be Kill'd if he ſtir out of his Houſe to morrow, it would not hinder you from going Abroad, tho' you firmly believe the threatning, becauſe it is a truth in which you are not <hi>Concern'd:</hi> But the Perſon ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if he does throughly believe the danger, will certainly not ſtir out of his Houſe that day, becauſe it is a Truth that he is very much <hi>Concerned in.</hi> On the other ſide, If you ſhould hear of a Promiſe made to another Perſon of a Thouſand Pound, if he will be at the Pains to go but to ſuch a place, it will not make you go there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Promiſe that you are not <hi>Concerned in;</hi> but the other Perſon, if he be certainly perſwaded the Promiſe will be made good to him, will certainly go to the appointed place, becauſe it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he is <hi>Concerned in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe, as to the caſe in hand; That a ſure Promiſe of the Pardon of our Sins, and Eternal Happineſs, is made over to us in the Second Covenant, on condition we will forſake the Service of Satan and of Sin, that we will Repent heartily, Believe practically, and Obey ſincerely, is a Truth that the Devils (to their great grief) are fully perſwaded of; for they <hi>believe and tremble, St. James</hi> tells us: But this Faith of theirs, does not put them upon Repentance and Amendment, becauſe thoſe gracious Promiſes do not <hi>Concern</hi> them, and they have no Promiſe of Salvation, tho' they ſhould Repent and Amend. But as to us, whom they do <hi>Concern,</hi> and to whom they are made, if we are really perſwaded, that if we amend, we ſhall be certainly Saved, we ſhall immediately, upon ſuch perſwaſion, ſeriouſly Repent of what has been done amiſs heretofore, and take care to Obey God for the future; <hi>for every Man that hath this Hope in God, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith are every one of 'em ſo many Motives, and thoſe the moſt powerful ones in the World, to ſtir us up to a diligent Reformation of our Hearts and Lives. They are in themſelves the moſt obliging Arguments to it, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us, they are the moſt <hi>Concerning</hi> and Important Truths that can be, containing in the meaning of 'em, either Threatnings to ſcare us out of Sin, or Promiſes to allure us to Obedience: Either ſuch conſiderations as are apt to excite our fears when we are in a courſe of Impiety, or are Grounds whereon we may build the vaſteſt hopes in the Performance of our Duty. And if any one does not live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>a Godly, Righteous, and a Sober Life,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, it is owing to ſome ſpice of Infidelity lurking in his heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is not throughly perſwaded of, or does not actually conſider theſe Truths; But he that does throughly Believe and Conſider them, can hardly fail of being a good Liver. Thus neceſſary, you ſee it is,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40806:132"/> that our Belief of all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith be ſuch, as does Influence us to good Works; And then, after all,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It muſt be a Belief that cauſes us to betake our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt to Interceed with God the Father for their Gracious Acceptance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> To Believe ſavingly, we muſt apply our ſelves to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to interceed with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our Gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</note> This I have formerly, in the beginning of my Expoſition, inſiſted upon; yet ſuch is the growing Infidelity of the World with reſpect to this, which is the moſt Eſſential part of Chriſtian Faith, that it would not be unſeaſonable, ſhould I again ſhew you <hi>that we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Mediation of Chriſt with the Father, for us, that our imperfect Righteouſneſs may be graciouſly accepted to our Juſtification.</hi> This is that Act of Faith which is called in Scripture <hi>Believing in Chriſt;</hi> and to ſuch a Believing as this it is, that our Juſtification is Attributed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>Know this, that a Man is not Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt; even we have Believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be Juſtify'd by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the Works of the Law, for by the Works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be Juſtify'd.</hi> And as this Act of Faith, the <hi>Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon God's Mercies in Chriſt, does wonderfully exalt the Divine Juſtice and Mercy, ſo it leaves no place to the Creature to Attribute any part of its Happineſs to it ſelf, but does utterly exclude all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Boaſting. <hi>God hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt his Son to be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins, that are paſt, through the forbearance of God. Where is Boaſting then? it is excluded. By what Law, of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 2.25, 27. So that it is not enough that we Believe punctually, but it is moreover neceſſary that we rely alſo on God's Mercies in Chriſt, that our imperfect Holineſs may be accepted; or otherwiſe, even our Aſſent to all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith will not avail us to our Juſtification and Salvation; which brings me,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>To ſhew you what it is to Believe ALL the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve All the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</note> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Believe <hi>ALL theſe Articles</hi> does Import, that we muſt Aſſent with a through perſwaſion of their undoubted Truth, and of their Divine Authority, to all and every one of thoſe great Articles of Chriſtian Doctrine contained in the Apoſtles Creed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> To Believe them All does Import, that we muſt Aſſent to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of thoſe great Articles of Chriſtian Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Apoſtles Creed.</note> This Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, is called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.17. <hi>That Form of Doctrine which was deliver'd to the Chriſtians;</hi> that is, that Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Practice of which they were deliver'd up, and ſolemnly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in their Baptiſm. And the ſame is call'd, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The Form of ſound words which was heard of the Apostle himſelf;</hi> and we are commanded to <hi>hold it faſt;</hi> that is, to take care not to depart from it in any part thereof.</p>
            <p>And as we muſt not ſhrink from the Confeſſion and Belief of any one of thoſe Articles, which have been handed down to us from the Apoſtles, in that Summary, or <hi>Form of ſound words,</hi> which makes up the Body of our Chriſtian Faith; ſo we muſt content our ſelves with the Belief of <hi>All</hi> thoſe ſaving Truths, and muſt not think there is any thing more to be Believ'd by our ſelves, or others, as neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

            <p>But eſpecially, we muſt take care of poſſeſſing our Minds with a Perſwaſion of the Truth of ſuch Articles, as do tend to deſtroy what the true Genuine Doctrines of Chriſtianity, <hi>viz. All the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Such as tend to deſtroy a good Life, and ſend us to other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors than Chriſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed with the Father for its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, no Articles of Chriſtian Faith.</note> do Build; as do all, or moſt at leaſtwiſe, of the New Articles impos'd upon the Belief of Chriſtians in the Romiſh Church. Some of thoſe Articles in the Romiſh Creed, do plainly take away the neceſſity of a Good Life, as might be eaſily made appear, were it proper here to inlarge on that Point. And other Doctrines of that Church, do as apparently take Men off from depending ſolely upon the Mediation of Chriſt with his Father, that he would graciouſly accept and paſs by the Imperfection of the good they do, teaching 'em to apply themſelves to the Bleſſed Virgin, and other Saints, as Mediators with God for 'em. Nay, and ſome of their Doctrines, as that of <hi>Merits,</hi> and of <hi>Works of Super-errogation,</hi> do teach 'em proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to overvalue their own Performances, and to <hi>boaſt</hi> themſelves in their Merit. And therefore ſo far muſt we be from ſuffering our ſelves to be perſwaded of the Truth of <hi>All</hi> theſe, and the like Doctrines, as Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, that we muſt utterly diſſent from them all, as Unjuſt and Unreaſonable Impoſitions on the Belief of Chriſtians. In a word; as we muſt ſtrengthen our ſelves in the Belief of <hi>All</hi> thoſe True and Genuine Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo to Believe <hi>All</hi> theſe, as neceſſary to Salvation, is enough. But to Believe more, under the Character of Articles of a Chriſtian's Faith, eſpecially if they be ſuch Doctrines as do take off the fears of Sinning, and ſend us to <hi>other Mediators betwixt God and Man, beſides the Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> this is indeed a Belief, not only ſuperfluous, as being a Belief of more than <hi>All</hi> the neceſſary Articles of a Chriſtian's Faith, but is a very ſinful, and criminal, and ſuperſtitious Perſwaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To Believe <hi>ALL the Articles</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith, is not only to Aſſent to <hi>All,</hi> and every of thoſe Articles in the Groſs, <hi>but to be fully perſwaded of all and every of thoſe ſingle Truths contained in each of thoſe Articles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> To Believe all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian Faith, is to be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all, and of every of thoſe ſingle Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in each of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> Every one of the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith is full of a great deal of Meaning, and many of them do contain Truths of various Kinds and Importance. Thus, for inſtance, To believe that Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>Crucify'd, Dead,</hi> and <hi>Buried,</hi> does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this <hi>Comfortable,</hi> as well as <hi>Fundamental</hi> Doctrine of Chriſtianity, <hi>That the Only Son of God ſuffered Death upon the Croſs for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that he made there by that one Oblation of himſelf once offered, a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And accordingly it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That Chriſt once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> And 21.24. it is ſaid, <hi>That he himſelf did bear our ſins in his own body on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then this is not the whole that is meant in that Grand Article, but alſo this other Doctrine, That he ſuffered to <hi>Redeem us from all Iniquity;</hi> that is, he ſuffered on the Croſs the puniſhment of our Sins, that we ſeeing how odious a thing Sin is, which could not be Aton'd for by a Sacrifice leſs valuable than the Blood of the Son of God, might therefore abhor it, and forſake it. And this is alſo taught us in the very place now cited from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> viz. 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He his own ſelf bear our ſins in his own Body upon the Tree, that we being dead to Sin ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40806:133"/>
            <p>And now a Perſon may become Guilty of Hereſie by believing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of thoſe Truths contained in the Articles.<note place="margin">A Heretick may be ſuch by Believing only of one of thoſe Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Article.</note> And accordingly there are two oppoſite Hereſies, which do at this day moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly afflict the Church of Chriſt amongſt us, and they do divide theſe two great Doctrines, contain'd in this one Article, betwixt 'em. And they are therefore Hereſies, becauſe they do ſo divide 'em, and do not each of 'em Believe both theſe important Doctrines. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> do Believe indeed, that Chriſt did ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for our Sins, but ſo as to leave no Conditions to be perform'd by them. And the <hi>Socinians,</hi> on the other ſide, owning that he came to draw us off from Sin, deny that he made any Satisfaction for us; So that both do fundamentally Err in the Faith, tho' they Believe the Article in the groſs, that Chriſt was <hi>Crucify'd, Dead and Buried,</hi> becauſe neither of them Believe the whole Truth contain'd in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. And therefore, as you muſt Believe <hi>All</hi> the Articles, ſo <hi>All</hi> thoſe Divine and Neceſſary Truths which are contain'd in every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of your Chriſtian Faith, according to the full Explication and Meaning thereof, given us in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds. Theſe Creeds do not contain more, or different Articles of Faith, than the Apoſtles Creed does; but in theſe <hi>Creeds,</hi> many Articles of our Chriſtian Faith are expreſs'd in the full Senſe and Importance of 'em, in oppoſition to thoſe Hereſies which did, and do ſtill pervert, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Meaning of thoſe Articles. And thus you alſo ſee, how you are to <hi>Believe All the Articles of your Chriſtian Faith;</hi> that you are not only to Believe every one of 'em, but all that Divine Truth which is contained in each.</p>
            <p>And ſo, as I have before laid before you, how you are to Renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, ſo now, what it is to <hi>Believe all the Articles of your Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And ſo it only remains (and then I ſhall have fully Explain'd to you all the Conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace) that I ſhew you next, what it is to obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of our Life.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40806:134"/> Service of God, (oppoſite to all Hypocriſie, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of obeying Him, when in reality we only ſerve our own Selves, or our own Luſts and Intereſts.) Entire it must be, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Obedience of the whole Man, to the whole Will of God, and that at all times; with this abatement of Rigour, That all our unwilling and involuntary Failings, which, through Ignorance and Frailty, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſhall, upon our Prayers to God, and Charity to our Neighbour, be forgiven us; and even our wilful Tranſgreſſions, when we repent and forſake 'em, through the Mediation of Chriſt, and the Grace of the Goſpel, ſhall not be imputed to our Condemnation.</hi> Such is the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which every one of you muſt carefully pay to the Holy Will and Commandments of God, as ever you hope to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But for your better underſtanding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Extent of your <hi>Chriſtian Obedience,</hi> I will a little farther un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold each Part of this Deſcription of it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Our Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel muſt be ſincere, by being a true and undiſſembled Service of God, oppoſite to all Hypocriſie, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of obeying Him, when in reality we only ſerve our own ſelves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1ſt. Our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience muſt be ſincere, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true and undiſſembled Service of God, oppoſite to all Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of obeying Him, when in truth we ſerve our own ſelves.</note> This is a certain Truth, That our Gracious God, for the moſt part, hath made ſuch Things the Matter of His Laws, and of our Duty, as really make for our own Intereſt, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Profit to perform; for ſo it really is to be <hi>Temperate,</hi> and <hi>Chaſte,</hi> and <hi>Contented,</hi> and <hi>Humble;</hi> to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> and <hi>Charitable,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable,</hi> &amp;c. But then our Obedience is <hi>ſincere,</hi> and done as unto God, when we obſerve His Laws for His ſake, and becauſe He commands it; for otherwiſe we do not obſerve <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> but our own: His Commands had no ſhare in what we did, becauſe it had been done although He had ſaid nothing. And thus <hi>ſincere</hi> muſt our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> be unto God (as ever we expect that God ſhould Judge us at the laſt Day to have obeyed Him:) I ſay, it muſt be done as unto God; and ſincerely from our Hearts to pleaſe Him, and not only our ſelves. And this is plainly expreſſed in the very Words of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for it accepts not an heartleſs Service, nor accounts it ſelf obeyed by what was never intended for it: <hi>The Lord thy God requires of thee to ſerve him with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul,</hi> Matth. 22.36, 37. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> does pray, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> may <hi>be ſincere</hi> in their Profeſſion, <hi>being filled with the Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or Good Works, <hi>to the Praiſe and Glory of God,</hi> not themſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
            <p>God indeed has not forbidden us all intending and deſigning of our own Advantage in the performance of his Commandments.<note place="margin">God does not forbid us all intending our Advantage in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> When He requires us to obey Him, He doth not forbid us all Love of our Selves, and Regard to our own Self-intereſts: For why? He does propoſe to us in Scripture the greateſt Rewards poſſible, as Motives to us, to perſuade us to obey. And the Bleſſed Saints in the Scripture, ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Service to God, are ſaid to have had an <hi>eye at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe of Reward.</hi> But then our Intention of our own Advantage in God's Service is forbidden, and renders our obedient Performances corrupt and inſincere, when together with our Intention of ſerving God, we either join, firſt, another Intention of ſerving Sin: Or, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we deſign ſome temporal Ends, as much, or more, than we deſign God's Service.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40806:134"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, That Man's Obedience is inſincere, <hi>who together with his Intentions of ſerving God, joins another Intention of ſerving Sin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">But, 1ſt. that Man's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Intention of ſerving God, joins another Intention of ſerving Sin.</note> as if a Man (as our Saviour tells us the Phariſees did) make <hi>long Prayers,</hi> and other Profeſſions of Religion, to enable him the better, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpicion, to <hi>devour Widows Houſes,</hi> as well as ſerve God. Where his obedient Performances ſlow from ſuch a mixture of Deſign as this, they will in no wiſe be owned as an obedient, but puniſhed as a ſinful Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, Men's Obedience is inſincere, <hi>when they deſign ſome temporal Ends in the practice of Vertue, as much or more than the deſign God's Service;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2dly, When he deſigns ſome temporal Ends in the practice of Vertue, as much, or more, than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends God's Service.</note> as when a Man is temperate, and will not drink, which is his Duty indeed, but yet only becauſe he cannot without making himſelf ſick. But when, in the performance of any Vertue, a Man has a regard as much, if not more, to his Profit or Eaſe, than to the Commands of God, in that caſe this Obedience is alſo <hi>inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> and will be far from entitling him to be an <hi>Inheritor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven:</hi> For thus to have as much regard to our worldly Profit or Pleaſure, in the performance of any Duty, as to pleaſe God, is a degrading of Him; it is a ſetting up the World for His Rival: And to bring other Things in Competition with Him, is plainly to renounce Him. In reſpect of our Love to God, we muſt even <hi>hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children,</hi> the deareſt Intereſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns we have in the World. He will be ſerved and reſpected above all; for He is jealous of the Pre-eminence of His Service above all Things, as an Husband is of his Wife's Love to him above other Men: <hi>I the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>am a jealous God,</hi> Exod. 20.5. And ſo much for that <hi>Sincerity</hi> which is required of us, as the firſt Qualification of an Acceptable <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That Evangelical or <hi>Goſpel-Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2dly, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt be entire, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </note> which now, under the Covenant of Grace, is the indiſpenſible Condition of every Man's Salvation, muſt be an <hi>entire Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel.</hi> Now this Integrity of our Obedience is ſuch a Perfection and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of it, as excludes all Maimedneſs and Defects; and this in another Word is ordinarily expreſs'd in Scripture by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> or <hi>walking uprightly.</hi> And to be upright in God's Ways, is not to ſtumble and fall by Sin or Diſobedience; but to be perfect and entire, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing in obedient Performances.</p>
            <p>And that our Obedience may be thus <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> it muſt be, Firſt, The Obedience of the <hi>whole Man:</hi> Secondly, To the <hi>whole Law:</hi> And, Thirdly, performed <hi>at all times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That our Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel may be entire, and ſo avail as to Life and Happineſs, it muſt be the Obedience of the whole Man;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1ſt. The Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the whole Man; that is,</note> we muſt take care to obey, with all the Powers and Faculties of our Nature: We muſt have our Underſtandings, our Wills, our Affections, and our Bodily Powers, obedient to God's Laws. And for this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the very Letter of the Law is expreſs; for when the Lawyer ask'd our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life, Luke</hi> 10.25. our Saviour ask'd, how it is written in the Law; who anſwering that it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt love</hi> (that is, ſerve, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.13.) <hi>the Lord thy God with all thine Heart,</hi> or Will, <hi>with all thy Soul,</hi> or Affections, <hi>with all thy Strength,</hi> or Bodily Powers, <hi>and with all thy Mind,</hi> or Underſtanding, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. When the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40806:135"/> Lawyer anſwered him, That thus indeed it was written in the Law (as it was <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.) our Saviour told him, he anſwered right; and bid him <hi>do this, and he ſhould live.</hi> Obedience, with all the Powers, and with the whole Nature, is the Means of Life, and the indiſpenſible Condition of our eternal Happineſs. And,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In the firſt place of the Mind and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt keep all God's Commandments with our Mind, or Underſtanding; that is, all the Thoughts and Imaginations, all the Contrivances and Counſels of our Hearts, muſt be governed by, and kept in obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel; ſo that we muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our ſelves, nor entertain in our Hearts evil Thoughts, wanton and vain Thoughts; nor muſt we purpoſe and contrive wicked and unjuſt Things, no more than we muſt outwardly act them. Thus the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4 tells us, That <hi>the Weapons of</hi> a Chriſtian's <hi>Warfare,</hi> muſt be <hi>mighty through God, to the pulling down Strong-holds, to the caſting down Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and to the bringing into captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ.</hi> This Text forbids all Thoughts and Contrivances of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Secondly, of the Will.</note> As ever we hope to have our Obedience avail us to Life and Happineſs; as we muſt keep our Minds and Underſtandings, ſo likewiſe our Wills, in Obedience to God's Commands. The Choice, as well as the Practice of our Duty, is plainly neceſſary to render it available to our Salvation; but, on the other ſide, he that would ſin, if he could conveniently and opportunely; if he chuſe Sin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he miſs of opportunity to act it; the bare Choice, without the Practice, is ſufficiently to his Condemnation. Thus our Lord Himſelf has determined it, <hi>Whoſoever looks on a Woman to luſt after her,</hi> or ſo long 'till his Heart conſent to commit Lewdneſs with her, if he could, though he never meet with an opportunity to act it, <hi>hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart,</hi> Matth. 5.28. This Text ſhews us, that we may diſobey in Willing, as well as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that we ſhall be condemned for a wicked Choice, as well as a wicked Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, of the Affections.</note> As we will render to God the Obedience of the whole Man, an <hi>entire Obedience,</hi> ſuch as will avail us to Salvation; we muſt regulate our Souls and Affections, conforming them wholly to what God commands: That is, we muſt love our Duty, as well as do it; and not to do it meerly out of Fear, but of out Love. To pretend Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and yet to love what he forbids; to make a ſhow of his Service, and yet in our very Hearts to hanker after his vileſt Enemies, our Sins, whom above all Things his Soul hates; this ſurely is not honeſtly to Serve, but groſly to Collogue, and flatly to Diſſemble with Him. And we muſt not do our Duty meerly out of Fear, I ſay, but out of Love; for thus to ſerve God againſt our Wills, is to ſubmit to Him, as a Slave doth to a tyrannous Lord; not through any Kindneſs for him, but through a hateful Fear of him. But this is ſuch a hateful way of performing Obedience, as God will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, nor accept of; for He ſcorns to be ſerved by a ſlaviſh Fear, and an unwilling Mind. <hi>No Man</hi> (as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24.) <hi>can ſerve two Maſters; for if he loves the one, he will hate the other: Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> By this he lets us know, that our Love and Obedience muſt go together, and be paid both to one God.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40806:135"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> As we will give God the Service and Obedience of the whole Man, an Entire Obedience, ſuch as he will Accept of to our Salvation, we muſt Obey him with all our Strength and bodily Powers: That is, we muſt not only Inwardly Approve of God's Commands as good in our Minds and Judgments, bear a Love to 'em with our Affections, and chuſe 'em with our Wills; but we muſt proceed Outwardly to Act, and do the Will of God in the Outward and Conſtant Practice of our Lives; we muſt put to our Strength and bodily Powers, and work the Will of God in our Lives and Actions. <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.7. <hi>let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is righteous:</hi> That is, you will be deceived, if you ſuffer others to perſuade you, or vainly flatter your ſelves, that there is any thing leſs than doing and acting vertuouſly and righteouſly, for which you ſhall be rewarded as vertuous and religious Perſons. Theſe Texts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many others, ſhew you the neceſſity, that our Inward good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceed to Outward good Operations; that you muſt go on to do good Deeds, before you are fit for the Great Reward; that we muſt work, as well as deſire, and not only will and like, but do our Duty; becauſe on nothing leſs than that we ſhall at the laſt Day be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the ſevere Service,<note place="margin">This the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſteful part;</note> and the diſtaſtful Part of our Duty. A ſecret Wiſh, or a ſudden Deſire of Obedience, may ſtart up in our Souls unawares; and there is not much oppoſition made to it, becauſe our Luſts receive no great hurt from it: And therefore they will allow us to think of Good, to ſpend a faint Reliſh, a ſudden Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or fruitleſs Deſire upon it; but if once we would go on to do our Duty, and to begin Obedience, then begins the Conflict; our Luſts then beſtirr themſelves with might and main, and ſet every Faculty on work to reſiſt and defeat it; for our Thoughts then begin to argue and to pick Quarrels with our Duty, our Wills then begin to be averſe, and our Affections to cool towards it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe in this Obedience of our Works and Actions,<note place="margin">And therefore endeavoured to be ſhifted off.</note> there is ſo much of difficulty, therefore are moſt People ſo deſirous to ſhift it off, and ſo forward to take up with any thing which will ſave them the labour of it: They perſuade themſelves, that God will admit of eaſier Terms; and build their Hopes on cheaper Services; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that it will be ſufficient to Salvation, that they <hi>Believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died for them;</hi> that God will accept of the <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Deed;</hi> that God will excuſe their Diſobedience, becauſe when they fall, it is by reaſon of ſtrong and violent Temptations: And, laſtly, that it is not without Reluctancy and great Unwillingneſs that they diſobey. But all theſe are deceitful Imaginations; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are againſt Sin in our Thoughts, and Minds, and Deſires, the working Wickedneſs will make us, in God's account, Sons of Sin and Diſobedience, and will be ſure to render ſuch Children of Wrath and Deſtruction. <hi>If you live after the Fleſh,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, you ſhall die, Rom.</hi> 8.13. And whatever Men think in their Minds, or deſire in their Hearts, or profeſs in their Words to the contrary; if for all that they continue to commit Sin in their Actions, Chriſt has told them plainly, That he will pronounce (when he comes to ſit as Judge) <hi>Depart from me, all ye that work Iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.23.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40806:136"/>
            <p>And thus you ſee what is, in the firſt place, neceſſary to make up an <hi>Entire Obedience;</hi> that our Obedience might be that of the whole Man; and that it may be ſuch, we muſt have our Minds, our Wills, our Affections, and, laſtly, our outward Actions, in Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel; that all theſe ſeveral Powers muſt unite in God's Service, before it will be <hi>Upright</hi> and Compleat, ſuch as at preſent his Law requires, and ſuch as at the laſt Day he will accept of, and reward us for.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> It muſt be an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the whole Law.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is neceſſary to the <hi>Integrity</hi> of our Obedience, that we Obey his Holy Will and Commandments with our whole Man, with our Minds, our Souls, our Wills, and our Strength; ſo that we <hi>Obey his whole Law,</hi> and Conform our ſelves to every of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. We muſt not think to pick and chuſe in the doing of our Duty; for if we do not Obey all, we Obey not right in any; becauſe all the Laws of God are bound upon us by the ſame Power, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the ſame Authority: So that if we fulfill any one upon this account of his having required it; the ſame reaſon holds for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>This indeed is very hardly believed, becauſe it is ſo hard to practiſe; for almoſt every Man has ſome Sin or other, which he can as well die as part with: It has got his Heart, and is become the Maſter of his Affections; and ſince he loves it ſo dearly, he hopes God will bear with it too.</p>
            <p>And when Men are thus deſirous to Obey God by halves, and would hope that this might ſerve the turn, they take to themſelves falſe Grounds and Confidences, under which they ſhelter themſelves, in the allowance or indulgence of ſuch Sins, as they are reſolved to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and when they do wilfully continue in the practice of any Sin, they uſually plead one or more of theſe Things in excuſe:</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">But in vain.</note>But whoſoever would Obey God's Laws, to the Salvation of his Soul, muſt Obey in every Inſtance, and continue wilfully to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in none; he muſt never hope to pleaſe God in nothing, but what he liſts himſelf: For the Obedience of the Covenant, whereinto Chriſt commiſſioned his Apoſtles to Baptize Converts, is nothing below an <hi>Entire Obedience: Go,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Baptize all Nations, teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commanded you,</hi> Matth. 28.19, 20.

That <hi>he who breaks the leaſt of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or none at all, which is the ſence of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe. So that the Obedience upon which alone we muſt expect to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> muſt be a Faithful and Entire Obedience to all the Laws and Commands of the Goſpel.

                  <hi>3dly,</hi> What it is to Walk in the ſame all the Days of our Lives.</note> we muſt continue in ſuch a Sincere and Entire Obedience, even to the End of our Lives. We muſt not think to pleaſe God by an Obedience, that comes and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40806:136"/> goes by Fits; or by ſerving him only at ſuch times as we are in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and have no Temptation to the contrary; but our Service of Him muſt be Conſtant and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform;</hi> we muſt obey Him in all things, and wilfully tranſgreſs in none.</p>
            <p>Some indeed there are, who parcel out their Time, and divide it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and their Sins; they obſerve a conſtant courſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing and Repenting, of Sin and Sorrow; for they are always won when they are tempted, and they are always ſorrowful when they have done: And others there are, who wholly fall off at laſt, and ſin againſt God for altogether.</p>
            <p>But now as for ſuch a broken Service as this is, God will by no means accept of it: For when Chriſt comes to Judgment,<note place="margin">God will not endure a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> he will paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon Men according to what they are then, and not according to what they have been formerly. <hi>If the righteous Man turn away from his Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity, and do according to all that the wicked Man doth; Shall he live?</hi> No, by no means: <hi>For all his Righteouſneſs that he hath done formerly, ſhall not be mentioned; but in his Treſpaſs that he hath ſince treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſince ſinned, in them ſhall he die,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. And it is they, <hi>which by patient continuing in Well-doing, ſeek for Glory and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that ſhall inherit <hi>eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7.</p>
            <p>But as for all thoſe who fall off from a good Courſe, and turn Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from Obedience, their Caſe is deſperate, and their Condition extreamly damnable: <hi>For if after Men have once eſcaped the Pollution of the World, through the Knowledge of Chriſt</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>they are again entangled therein, and overcome;</hi> then is <hi>the latter End worſe with them than the Beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. So that the Obedience which God will accept, and which will render us <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> muſt be, as of our whole Man, and to all the Laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; ſo it muſt be perform'd to 'em at all times: We muſt perſevere in it through all Seaſons, and take care both to live and die in it; for our Reward will be diſpenced unto us, according to the nature of our Service, at the time of Payment, and <hi>he</hi> only, as our Saviour ſays, <hi>that endureth to the End, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 10.22.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhew'd you, <hi>firſt,</hi> What it is to <hi>Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments,</hi> or how far you muſt be Obedient to the Holy Will and Commandments of God, as ever you will hope to obtain Salvation, or to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> I have alſo ſhewed you, What it is to <hi>Walk in the ſame all the Days of your Life,</hi> or how long you muſt perſevere in ſuch Obedience, even to the End of your Lives. In ſhort, I have alſo ſhewed you, That the Obedience which is the Condition of our Salvation, even now under the Goſpel, muſt be a Sincere and Entire Obſervance of all the Laws of Chriſtianity. Sincere it muſt be, as I have ſhewed you, by being a true and undiſſembled Service, oppoſite to all Hypocriſie, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of Obeying him, when in reality we only ſerve our own ſelves, our own Luſts and Intereſts. And Entire it muſt be, by being the Obedience of the whole Man, to the whole Law; and not for ſome ſhort, but for our whole Time, and to the End of our Lives.</p>

               </label> But here it will be demanded, That if this be that Obedience, which now under the Goſpel, or <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> is required, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Condition of our being made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> wherein lies the difference between this, and the <hi>Firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or Covenant of Works, which Chriſt came to purchaſe our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from, and to eſtabliſh this in its room? The Condition of the Firſt (as I have told you) was no leſs than a <hi>Perfect, Exact, Unſinning Obedience,</hi> the never offending in any one Point; and if our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now muſt be ſo <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>Entire</hi> an Obedience of the Whole Man, to all the Laws of the Goſpel, and this to be performed at all times (as has been now deſcribed) wherein does this come ſhort, you'll ſay, of that <hi>Perfect Obedience,</hi> required of us in our State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or that <hi>Legal Obedience</hi> required under the Covenant of Works?</p>
            <p>And now therefore, to clear the Doctrine of <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. The difference between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical and a Legal Obedience.</note> as thus ſtated from any ſuch Doubt, as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Covenants in matter of Rigour; I ſhall ſhew that there is a very material Difference, and ſuch as makes this we are now under, deſervedly be ſtyled a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> And the difference is this, That whereas under the Firſt, the Obedience was to be ſo perfect, that there was no Mercy upon the leaſt Tranſgreſſion; but the Offender became immediately liable to the threatned Puniſhment. Now under the Second, as Sincere and Entire as our Obedience muſt be; yet no more is required at our hands, than what by God's Grace, and our own honeſt Endeavours, we ſhall be enabled to perform. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the Weakneſs of our Nature is ſuch, that we cannot continue in an unſinning Obedience; though all our wilful and choſen Sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if perſiſted in, will ſtill put a Barr to our Salvation; yet all our Unavoidable <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and Involuntary Tranſgreſſions, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly forgiven us; and even our Wilful and more Heinous Sins, when by Repentance we bewail and forſake 'em, and take better care to Avoid 'em for the future, they alſo, through the Mediation of Chriſt, according to the Terms he has obtained for us in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, ſhall be forgiven us, and not prejudice our being <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace, is not ſo great, but <hi>our Wilful Choſen Sins, if ſtill perſiſted in, will put a Barr to our Salvation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence not ſo great, but that our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and choſen Sins will put a Barr to our Salvation.</note> A <hi>wilful Sin</hi> is when we ſee and conſider of the Sinfulneſs of any Action, which we are tempted to, and after that chuſe to Act and Perform it. Every Sin againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, is a wilful Sin, when our own Heart rebukes and checks us at the time of Sinning, telling us, that God hath forbidden that which we are about to do; notwithſtanding which, we preſume to do it. And as for them, they are all of an heinous Guilt, and of a <hi>crying Nature;</hi> ſuch Sins are a deſpiſing of God's Law, and therefore are call'd <hi>Preſumptuous Sins,</hi> and are ſaid to be acted through a Rebellious Pride, and with an high Hand, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.30.</p>
            <p>And thoſe who have committed ſuch, are ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>to have done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> becauſe as well the Spirit of God, as their own Reaſon have reſiſted 'em in the committing of ſuch Sins, which Reſiſtance notwithſtanding they have violently broke through.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40806:137"/> And as to ſuch Sins therefore, they will make us the Children of Wrath, and ſubject us to puniſhment, as well now, as under the Law, as is evident from that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. now mentioned: <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes's <hi>Law, died without Mercy; of how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Thing,</hi> (which they do who do wholly apoſtatize) <hi>and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> which they do who do ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>And this they will be accounted to do, whether ſuch Sins be <hi>Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and Expreſly Wilful and Choſen, or only <hi>Indirectly</hi> ſo,<note place="margin">Some Sins are directly and expreſly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> and by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Sometimes Men eye and view the Sin they are about to commit, before they chuſe or act; they pauſe and deliberate, doubt and demurr about it; they have a Conflict and Diſpute in their own Minds, whether they ſhould commit or keep off from it: And when notwithſtanding this they commit it, that Sin is then directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly choſen and wilful, and <hi>done in deſpight of the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and is therefore of a very heinous and damning Nature.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there are other ſinful Actions which are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen directly and expreſly, but only <hi>indirectly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively.</note> and by interpretation; that is, when Men expreſly chuſe ſuch a ſtate of Things, as make ſome ſinful Actions after that, to be no longer a matter of free Choice, but almoſt neceſſary and unavoidable. Thus he that wilfully drinks 'till he is drunk, and then in his Drink commits Murder and Uncleanneſs, or any other mad Frolicks, or ſinful Extravagances, without any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration or conſideration at all, ſhall nevertheleſs be judged to have wilfully committed thoſe Sins, becauſe he did deliberately and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into that Sin of Drunkenneſs, which when he was in (by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf of his Reaſon) made thoſe, or any other Sins, unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable at that time. So again, he that watches not over, but indulges and gives way to his Paſſions, and in his Anger kills a Man; and he that accuſtoms himſelf to a Sin ſo often, that he knows not when he commits it, as to ſwear, in either of theſe caſes alſo, he ſhall be judged wilfully in God's account to have committed Murder, and to have ſwore; becauſe any Man may chuſe to indulge and humour his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to accuſtom himſelf to that Sin, which makes his falling into other Sins ſo unavoidable. And, laſtly, he that wilfully neglects the means of attaining to any Grace or Vertue, will be judged wilfully to have <hi>omitted</hi> his Duty, which in the uſe of due means he might have done acceptably. Thus in either of theſe caſes, when Men fall into any Sin, either by Drunkenneſs, or by indulging, and not watching over their Paſſions; or by reaſon of having long accuſtomed themſelves to ſuch Sins; or, laſtly, by neglecting the Means of attaining to any Grace or Vertue: In any of theſe caſes, he that commits a Sin, his Sin will be accounted as <hi>indirectly,</hi> and interpretatively choſen and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, becauſe he did willingly do thoſe things which brought and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray d him into ſuch Sin; or wilfully neglected thoſe Means which would have preſerved him from them. And ſo his Sin will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as a choſen and wilful Sin, and a Tranſgreſſion of God's Law, and he puniſhed as a wilfully diſobedient Perſon. So that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Goſpel is not ſuch, as that wilful Sins
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40806:138"/> ſhall be now unpuniſh'd.<note place="margin">But the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, 1ſt. that thoſe who ſincerely and entirely obey, ſhall not be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary ſins.</note> But here the difference is very great and comfortable; and it is this, That,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Our unchoſen and involuntary Sins, which, through the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Frailty of our Nature, we cannot always avoid, through the Mediation of Chriſt, now under the Covenant of Grace;</hi> thoſe who ſincerely and entirely Obey the Laws of the Goſpel, ſhall not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account for ſuch.</p>
            <p>And ſuch unchoſen and involuntary Sins, are thoſe which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit either through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> becauſe we did not underſtand our Duty; or through <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> becauſe we did not think of it. And unleſs our Ignorance and Inconſideration be themſelves wilful, we ſhall not be condemned for the Failings we have committed through either of 'em.</p>
            <p>The firſt cauſe of an innocent and pardonable Involuntarineſs, is <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our Duty,<note place="margin">The firſt cauſe of an innocent Involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Duty.</note> when we do what God forbids, becauſe we do not know that He has forbid it; for ſuch Failings as we ignorantly commit, we ſhall not be condemned under the Covenant of Grace; for Chriſt, who is our High Prieſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>will have compaſſion on the Ignorant, and them that are out of the Way,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Provided it be not wilful.</note>True it is, there are thoſe that are wilfully ignorant; for either they ſhut their Eyes, and will not ſee their Duty, or they are idle and careleſs, and will not enquire after it: So that if they do not know their Duty, it is becauſe they do not deſire the Knowledge of it, or will be at no pains for it; they neither read the Word, nor come to hear it, nor to be Catechiſed; and if they do come, neither think nor conſider afterwards upon what they have heard; nor pray to God to make all thoſe means of Knowledge effectual to their Salvation. And in the neglect of theſe Means of Knowledge, they make themſelves wilfully ignorant; and ſo their Ignorance will not be their Excuſe, but their condemning Sin, becauſe it was wilful and choſen. But if you have an honeſt Heart, deſirous to be taught, that you may know and do your Duty; and uſe an honeſt Induſtry, by Reading, coming to be Catechiſed, by conſtantly Hearing of the Word. If thus you do all that lies upon you to be informed what you ought to do, and yet afterwards, if through Miſunderſtanding, you fail, then through the Grace of the Goſpel, and the Mediation of our Saviour, what you have been wanting in, will not be imputed to your Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What you do unwillingly commit through <hi>Inconſideration.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2d. <hi>Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </note> We ſometimes do things we do not think nor conſider the Evil of 'em when we commit 'em; and ſo their Sinfulneſs being unſeen, is alſo unchoſen; and theſe Slips do ſo ſteal from us, without our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thinking of 'em,<note place="margin">Inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on excuſes, <hi>1.</hi> When through ſurprize.</note> ſeveral ways; either, firſt, by ſurprize, and a ſudden Temptation. And thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon an unexpected occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was ſurprized into a ſudden Anger, and into an unadviſed Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards the High Prieſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. And the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a ſingle Paſſion, whether of Anger or Envy, and the unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Slips of the Tongue, generally enter this way. Or, ſecondly, we venture upon ſeveral Actions without thinking of their ſinfulneſs, through our natural Wearineſs, and the length and conſtancy of a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40806:138"/> Temptation. Thus in times of Affliction, or Sickneſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> When through natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wearineſs, and the length and ſtrength of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> by the unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Fleſh, and the hardneſs of Man's Condition, a Perſon is ſometimes tempted to fret and murmur, and to be peeviſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining: And ſo we find it was with <hi>Job,</hi> who though a Man patient to a Proverb, and one to whom, by the Teſtimony of God Himſelf, <hi>there was none Equal in the whole Earth, a perfect and an upright Man, one who feared God, and eſchewed Evil,</hi> Job 1.8. Yet this Man, I ſay, of admirable Conſtancy and Patience, was wearied out of his Watchfulneſs, by a tedious trial of Afflictions; and in that time of his Unadviſedneſs, uttered many Things impatient with his Lips, as appear from his whole Hiſtory. And, laſtly, we ſometimes inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and unadviſedly do an ill Thing, by reaſon of the violent Diſcompoſure and Diſturbance of our thinking Powers, when our Mind is ſo diſturbed, that on a ſudden we cannot think what we do;<note place="margin">Laſtly, When by the violent diſcompoſure of our Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, our Minds are ſo diſturbed, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think what we do.</note> as upon a ſudden Grief, Anger, or Fear. And thus <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was a Perſon ſo dear to God, that if he could be intreated by any Man, he tells us it would be by him, or <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtanding to intercede before him; did yet in an inſtance that would have drawn him into the hazard of his Life, diſpute God's Command, when he ſhould have perform'd it, and queſtion where in Duty it became him to Obey; for when God did bid him go and Anoint <hi>David</hi> King, which Service was ſure to draw upon him the implacable Hatred of <hi>Saul;</hi> through the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den force of that frightful Thought, inſtead of Obeying, he anſwers again, ſaying, <hi>How can I go? for if</hi> Saul <hi>hear of it, he will kill me,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1, 2. So that as for thoſe Slips, which we do unwillingly commit, through either of theſe Cauſes of <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> they are a matter of God's Mercy, and will be graciouſly born with, and forgiven now under the Goſpel and <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> for all thoſe Perſons now mentioned as guilty of the like, St. <hi>Paul, Job,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> were in a ſtate of Grace, and the dear Children of God; I ſay therefore, they will be graciouſly born with, and forgiven.</p>
            <p>Provided, firſt, we never be guilty of 'em,<note place="margin">Ignorance and Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excuſe not theſe Sins, <hi>1.</hi> Which we have time to underſtand and obſerve; nor, <hi>2.</hi> Crying Sins; nor, <hi>3.</hi> Thoſe we do not endeavour againſt; nor, laſtly, Which we are not ſorry for.</note> when we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of, and time to obſerve 'em, nor, ſecondly, in any great and crying Sin, as <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. for no Man can pretend he did unwittingly commit ſuch things, as a Man's Conſcience will preſently ſtart at: Provided, thirdly, we do endeavour and ſtrive, and watch againſt 'em: And, laſtly, after we find that we have fallen into 'em, provided we be ſorry, and earneſtly beg God's pardon for 'em. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus, ſuch Slips and Infirmities, as we do commit unadviſedly and inconſiderately, ſhall not be laid to our charge.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee, that our <hi>unavoidable</hi> Infirmities, and our <hi>unwilling</hi> Tranſgreſſions, which through an unaffected <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and an involuntary <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> we do commit, ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our Condemnation now under the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace. And this is the firſt great Difference between the Firſt Covenant, wherein the leaſt Sin was Unpardonable, and this Second Covenant, or the Covenant of Grace, wherein, through the Mediation of CHRIST, all our Unwilling, Involuntary Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall be graciouſly paſs'd by.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40806:139"/>
            <p>The Second great Difference is, That even our wilful and more heinous Sins, when by our <hi>Repentance</hi> we bewail and forſake 'em, and take better care to avoid 'em for the future; they alſo, through the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> according to the Terms he has obtained for us in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſhall be forgiven us,<note place="margin">The <hi>2d.</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Legal and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, That our wilful and more heinous nous Sins when Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of through the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, according to the Terms he has obtained for us in the Covenant of Grace, ſhall be forgiven us.</note> and not prejudice our being <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the ſtrictneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, the Puniſhment took place upon the firſt wilful breach: <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, if it were in an inſtance where the Law threatned death, <hi>died without Mercy,</hi> Heb. 10.28. A Man that had committed <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Murder,</hi> or any other Crime, whereof Death was the eſtabliſh'd Puniſhment, was to the without Remedy; for no Sacrifice would be accepted for him, nor would the Law admit of any Favour or Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt came into the World, his Buſineſs was to abrogate all the Rigour of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, as well as that of the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> and to preach an Univerſal Pardon upon Repentance. Now under the Covenant of Grace, God doth not caſt us off upon the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every Sin, but as he is heartily deſirous that we ſhould repent of it, according to that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I do not delight in the death of a Sinner, but rather that he return, and live.</hi> So when we repent, he has oblig'd Himſelf, by his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to forgive it, according to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> Epiſt. 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the great Doctrine of the Goſpel, which is a Covenant of Remiſſion of Sins upon our Repentance;<note place="margin">Remiſſion of Sins upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the great Doctrine of the Goſpel.</note> and therefore our Saviour, when he began himſelf to preach it, he ſaid, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Matth. 4.17. And when he left the World, he commanded his Diſciples, that they ſhould declare to the World the Pardon of Sins upon their Repentance; for ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Ch.</hi> 24.47. that he gave 'em in charge, <hi>That Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preach'd in his Name to all Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus has God provided us of means, which will moſt certainly reſtore us to his Favour. He has not left us in a forſaken ſtate, but has preſcribed us this Method of Repentance to recover us out of it, and to be the great Inſtrument of our Pardon and Reconciliation. And our Repentance, through the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> will be accepted for our Pardon, whatever our Sins have been, whether known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; whether they have been wilful or involuntary Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Repentance will be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to our pardon, for our known or ſecret Sins, whether wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, but now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. <hi>2.</hi> For our moſt known and wilful Sins, if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</note>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our unknown, or ſecret Sins, which whether wilfully or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly we have committed, but now we have forgot, ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us upon our hearty, though general Prayer to God to forgive us; ſuch as was that of <hi>David, O cleanſe me from my ſecret Faults, Pſal.</hi> 19.12. and upon our diligent care hereafter, not knowingly and wilfully to tranſgreſs any of God's Laws. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our moſt unknown and wilful Sins, even they ſhall alſo be forgiven us, if for every particular Sin we know our ſelves to have committed, we particularly repent of it by confeſſing it to God, and by taking care to amend and forſake it for the future.</p>
            <p>'Till we are reclaimed indeed from our former Sins, and are become God's dutiful Sons and faithful Servants for the preſent, and for the future; it is not conſiſtent with the Honour of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:40806:139"/> with the <hi>Authority</hi> of his Laws, and with the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his Government, to receive us into his Favour: But as ſoon as ever we are conſcientiouſly reform from our Sins, he will be reconciled to us if we are heartily ſorry for what has been paſt, and amended for the future; and in caſe of Injury and Wrong done to God or Man, we undo, as much as in us lies, what has been done amiſs, by making amends, and reparation for what we have injured either.</p>
            <p>We cannot be ſaid to repent of a Sin, unleſs <hi>we undo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And in caſe of Injury to Man, if Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution be made.</note> 
               <hi>as much as in us lies, what has been done amiſs:</hi> Therefore if any one has offended his Neighbour, and given him juſt cauſe of Anger againſt him; he that will truly repent, and expect that God will hear his Prayers for his Pardon, muſt go and acknowledge his Offence, endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Neighbour, and be reconciled to him; for ſo our Saviour has ordered, <hi>Matth</hi> 5.23. <hi>before</hi> he offer his Prayer to God. And he that has injured his Neighbour, either by taking away his good Name by Slander, or his Goods by wrong Dealing, muſt take off the Slander, and reſtore what he has unjuſtly got; and ſo did good <hi>Zacheus,</hi> upon his Repentanee, we find, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. when he embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe towards the <hi>Reparation</hi> of God's Honour, I muſt needs add, as a neceſſary part of Repentance,<note place="margin">Of high Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God and Religion, if that be not repaired by an eminent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> that he who has formerly liv'd a very notorious and ſcandalouſly ill Life, to the great Diſhonour of God and Religion, muſt now, towards the Reparation of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, be as famous for his eminent and exemplary Piety, that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may be accepted, a private Sorrow for publick Scandals fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vaſtly ſhort of <hi>undoing what has been done amiſs,</hi> in which conſiſts the reſtitutive part of Repentance. The neceſſity of this, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the caſe of the Woman <hi>who waſhed our Saviour's Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head,</hi> Luke 7.44. She had formerly, it ſeems, been a very vile Woman; but the reaſon why <hi>her Sins, which were many, were forgiven,</hi> is ſaid by our Saviour to have been, becauſe ſhe <hi>loved much,</hi> verſ. 47. And thus if we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, our Sins ſhall not be imputed to us; but through the Merits of Chriſt's Death, and the Grace of the Goſpel, they ſhall be looked upon as if they had never been.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewed you that other great Difference betwixt that Obedience required now under the Covenant of Grace, and the Obedience required by the Firſt Covenant; That whereas the Obedience required by the Firſt, was a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Obedience,</hi> the never Offending at all. Now not only our involuntary Sins and <hi>Infirmities;</hi> but alſo our moſt voluntary and and wilful Tranſgreſſions, when by Repentance we bewail and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake 'em, and take better care to avoid 'em for the future; they alſo, through the Mediation of Chriſt, according to the Terms he has obtained for us in the Covenant of Grace, ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us, and not prejudice our being <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon the whole, I have now ſhewed you,<note place="margin">The ſum of Evangelical Obedience.</note> as to all that Obedience required now under the Goſpel, to make us <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that there is not required indeed, a Perfect, Exact, Unſinning Obedience, the never offending in any one part, which was the indiſpenſible Condition of the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40806:140"/> but there muſt be a Sincere and Entire Obedience paid to all the Laws of the Goſpel: Sincere it muſt be, by being a true and undiſſembled Service, Obeying 'em not only becauſe moſt for our Health and Intereſt, as generally the Laws of Religion are; but even where they are contrary to our Inclinations and Intereſt, becauſe God commands us. And entire it muſt be, by being the Obedience of the whole Man, of our Underſtanding, our Wills, our Affections, and our Actions, to the whole Law of God, and that at all times. And this if we endeavour the beſt we can to do, that our unwilling and involuntary Failings, which through <hi>Ignorance</hi> and Frailty we commit, ſhall, upon our Prayers to God, be forgiven us; and that our wilful Tranſgreſſions, when we repent of, and forſake 'em, through the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> and the Grace of the Goſpel, ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our Condemnation.</p>
            <p>In a word; That Obedience (to ſpeak alſo in the Words of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>)<note place="margin">The ſum alſo thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </note> which is the Condition of the <hi>Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and of our being made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Negatively it is not a Perfect, Exact, Unſinning Obedience, the never offending at all in any kind of Sin, (this is the Condition of the Firſt Covenant.) Nor, ſecondly, is it never to have committed any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Sin in the former courſe of our Lives. Nor, thirdly, never to have gone on, or continued in any habitual or cuſtomary Sin for the time paſt: But it is poſitively the <hi>New Creature,</hi> or Renewed, Sincere Honeſt, Faithful Obedience to the whole Goſpel, giving up the whole Heart unto Chriſt, the performing of that which God enables us to perform, and bewailing our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and Frailties, and Sins, both of the paſt and preſent Life, and beſeeching God's Pardon in Chriſt for all ſuch, and ſincerely labouring to mortifie every Sin, and to perform an uniform Obedience to God, and from every Fall riſing again by Repentance. And thus, if we Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and Walk in the ſame all the Days of our Life, we ſhall not fail to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have fully explained to you all the Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> both on God's part and on ours; both what it is to be a Member, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which are the Mercies and Favours made over to us therein on God's part, and what it is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Conditions to be performed on ours.</p>
            <p>My next Task muſt be, and then I ſhall give you a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that pertains to the Nature and Subſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace) to ſhew you, what a happy ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this is, to be in ſuch a gracious Covenant with GOD; By whoſe Mediation we obtained it; By whom and how we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into it: And, laſtly, what infinite Thanks we owe to God for Calling us into this ſtate of Salvation: All which Points we have taught us in theſe Words: <hi>And I thank God our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>

               <hi>THE XXIV. Lecture.</hi> And I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that He hath Called me to this State of Salvation, through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</head>
            <p>I Have already, in order to a full Explication of all that pertains to the nature of the Covenant of Grace, given you an account of the Terms and Conditions of it, both on God's part, and on ours, as they are laid down and taught you in your Church-Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>The Invaluable Priviledges on God's part, made over to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as you are taught in your Catechiſm, and I have explained 'em to you are, firſt, That you are therein <hi>made Members of Chriſt;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Children of God;</hi> and, thirdly, <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And thoſe Conditions to be performed by us, our part of the Covenant, are, That we ſhould, <hi>first, Renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. Secondly, That we ſhould believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly, That we ſhould keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of our Life.</hi> And what each ſeveral Article in this your gracious Covenant doth mean and import, I have hitherto (according to the beſt of my Skill) been explaining to you.</p>
            <p>And now, if there be any thing farther neceſſary to a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Explication of the Nature of this Covenant, it muſt be this, in the ſecond place, to ſhew you, <hi>How that thereby you are reſtored to a ſtate of Salvation:</hi> Thirdly, By whoſe Mediation you obtained ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Covenant, and are put thereby into a ſtate of Salvation; <hi>It was through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Fourthly, By whom and how we have been Called to this ſtate of Salvation; It was <hi>our Heavenly Father, who hath called us to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> And, laſtly, What infinite reaſon you have <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to thank Almighty God our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called you to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called me to this State,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:40806:141"/>
            <p>And as all theſe Points are fairly taught you in theſe Words of your Catechiſm; ſo in commenting upon theſe, I will, by God's Aſſiſtance, open and explain theſe ſeveral Points to you. To proceed therefore, in order to a more compleat underſtanding of the whole Nature of the Covenant of Grace, let us ſee,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How this Covenant, whoſe Terms and Conditions I have been explaining to you, <hi>does reſtore us to a ſtate of Salvation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That in the Covenant of Grace, we are reſtored to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does import a deliverance from Danger or Miſery; and a <hi>State of Salvation</hi> does import the being put into a Condition of Safety, where one may be ſafe and ſecure from Danger and Miſery, if he pleaſe. For our underſtanding therefore, how this Covenant of Grace is a means of reſtoring us to a State of Salvation, we muſt look back and conſider, how we brought our ſelves into a State of Danger and Miſery before; and how by the Covenant of Grace we are put again into a State of Safety and Security, if we pelaſe.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe we muſt know, That God Almighty created Man at firſt in ſuch a ſtate of Perfection,<note place="margin">How we brought our ſelves into a ſtate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery before.</note> with ſuch an enlightned Mind, ſuch a regular Will to the Laws of right Reaſon, and with ſuch obedient Appetites and Affections, that he might, if he would, have continued in perfect Innocency: And now making him thus upright, and capable to perform ſuch an Obedience, God did very reaſonably make this Covenant with Man, That he ſhould perform a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſinning Obedience,</hi> and live for ever: But upon the leaſt Sin, the eating of the Fruit of one Forbidden Tree, he ſhould ſurely die. The Event of which Proceeding was, that Man hearkning to the Suggeſtions of the Devil, did thereby rebell againſt his Maker, take part with Satan, and ſo did forfeit all his Right and Hopes of Happineſs; which upon the faithful Performance of his Covenant he would have had, was ſhut out of Paradiſe, and condemned to death, as you will ſee largely deſcribed in the third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Thus did Man, by the breach of his Covenant with God, bring himſelf into a ſtate of Danger and extream Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How by the Covenant of Grace we are put into a ſtate of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we pleaſe.</note>And now here it comes in for us to conſider the Second Covenant, as that which reſtores us to a <hi>ſtate of Salvation.</hi> Had the Firſt remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned uncancelled, and in full force, we muſt have all periſhed without remedy, upon a double account: It required an unſinning Obedience, and we had ſinned: It allowed no place for Repentance after Sin, and yet we had brought our ſelves into that State, that <hi>except we ſhould repent,</hi> and our Repentance be accepted, <hi>we must all undoubtedly have periſhed.</hi> We were unavoidably therefore bound up by that <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> as the caſe then ſtood with us, to Death and Miſery; and it was not poſſible for the Wit of Man to contrive any way to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>And now when we were in this irrepairable State, was God of his own Goodneſs graciouſly pleaſed to <hi>cancel the Firſt Covenant, blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.14. By which place is more immediately meant, I muſt confeſs, his <hi>concelling</hi> and making void, as to any condemning Power in it, the Covenant of Works made with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the hand of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> but not ſo as to exclude his cancelling all former Covenants that were too rigorous and impoſſible for Man in his <hi>fallen State</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40806:141"/> I conclude therefore, that God was graciouſly pleaſed to <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> and make void the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> under which Man was created, and which he was uncapable of performing and receiving Benefit by, having forfeited that perfect Light, and perfect Strength, which ſhould enable him to perform it, and become very defective and weak both in Knowledge and Ability of performing his Duty towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And he was pleaſed to grant unto us, and to eſtabliſh with us a <hi>Second,</hi> by way of Remedy againſt the Rigour and Extremity of the <hi>Firſt;</hi> wherein God, as it were, deſcending from his Majeſty and Glory, does oblige himſelf to make good to ſuch, as ſhall enter into it, and continue faithful therein, thoſe ineſtimable Favours and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which do vaſtly exceed thoſe of the former. For, in the firſt place, whereas the Firſt Covenant did not (as far as I can find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) any where <hi>Expreſly</hi> promiſe Eternal Life in Heaven, to thoſe that were faithful in it: The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> whereunto you are called, does, in innumerable places, propoſe immortal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to all thoſe that do <hi>Believe</hi> its Doctrines and Articles, and do ſincerely Obey its Precepts, as has been ſhewed you; for it is <hi>Jeſus Christ who hath brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. And then, ſecondly, whereas under the Firſt, there was no place for Repentance; but nothing leſs than an Exact and Unſinning Obedience, was the Condition of this Life and Happineſs: And upon the firſt and leaſt Offence, all was become forfeit and loſt. Herein we have this relaxation of Rigour, and exceeding Favour, That even the greateſt Sinners, upon their Repentance and Return to God, ſhould be ſaved; and our Saviour therefore left Commiſſion with his Diſciples, That <hi>Pardon and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preach'd in his Name, amongſt all Nations,</hi> Luke 24.47. Thus, in the Covenant of Grace, is Repentance, like a Plank thrown out, which if Ship-wreck'd Sinners lay hold on, they may ſave themſelves; and the Covenant it ſelf like a Ship, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, whereinto thoſe that enter, and will continue in it, may be landed ſafe in the Kingdom of Heaven So that the Covenant of Grace, in whoſe Terms and Conditions you have been lately inſtructed, does reſtore us you ſee into a ſtate of Salvation, whereby we are put again into a ſtate of Safety and Security, if we pleaſe.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it will be infinitely worth our Enquiry, by whoſe <hi>Mediation</hi> we obtained ſuch a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored thereby into a ſtate of Salvation.<note place="margin">That by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt it was, that we obtained ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant, whereby we are reſtored to a ſtate of Salvation.</note> And it was <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> You have ſeen how wretchedly Man did break his Covenant with his Maker, and into what a miſerable ſtate he plung'd himſelf thereby.</p>
            <p>And now behold the unſpeakable Goodneſs of God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, declared in Jeſus Chriſt his Son! When God's Juſtice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Sin ſhould be puniſh'd; when his Holineſs forbad, that a thing ſo contrary to his Nature, and hateful unto him, as Sin is, ſhould eſcape the ſevereſt Marks of his Diſpleaſure, and when his Wiſdom would not ſuffer it to eſcape Puniſhment, leſt his Creatures ſhould take occaſion from thence to rebell the more againſt him; when for theſe Reaſons it was neceſſary that the Sin of Man ſhould be moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh'd; then did Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God interpoſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40806:142"/> betwixt Vengeance and us, and did mediate and intercede with his Father, to pardon and forgive us the Breach of our Covenant, he laying down his own Life a Ranſom for our Sins, to redeem us from Miſery, and paying his own Blood a Satisfaction for our Offences: This we have taught us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all.</hi> And, moreover, becauſe having fallen from our Uprightneſs, and loſt that perfect Light and Strength, whereby in a ſtate of Innocence we had been able to perform a perfect, exact, and unſinning Obedience, the Conditions of the Firſt Covenant; becauſe this we were no longer able to do; and therefore ſo long as we remained bound to perform the Firſt Covenant, we muſt have been however loſt; Jeſus Chriſt did therefore, I ſay, moreover mediate and intercede with his Father in our behalf, and purchaſing the Grace and Favour with his precious Blood, did obtain for us a better Covenant, a Second and more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant, inſtead of the Firſt, which was more rigorous; a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant conſiſting of ſuch Conditions, as by his Grace we ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to perform, and of far better Promiſes to encourage our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Performances; for which reaſon he is therefore ſtyled the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>
            <p>In particular, He did obtain theſe infinitely happy Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for us (as has been already ſhewn you) that if we would renounce God's Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and return to our Obedience (which is in other Words to repent) we ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as <hi>his Children,</hi> and have all our former Rebellions pardoned us: That if we will firmly and practically <hi>Believe</hi> in God, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who died and ſuffered for us, we ſhould be <hi>Members of his Body, the CHURCH,</hi> and partake of all thoſe manifold Graces and Privileges he has purchas'd for it. And, laſtly, if inſtead of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, exact, unſinning Obedience, we would but perform a <hi>Sincere</hi> and Honeſt one, ſuch as, by the Grace he would afford us, we ſhould be enabled to, we ſhould finally be made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thus did Jeſus Chriſt mediate and intercede with God the Father for our pardon, upon the Breach of the Firſt Covenant, paying down his own Life a Satisfaction for the Injuſtice done by us to God, in violating of it, and did purchaſe and procure of God the Father, to be reconciled to us upon eaſier Terms, ſuch as thoſe in the Covenant of Grace now mentioned.</p>
            <p>And now let us behold here, and admire the Infinite Wiſdom alſo, as well as Goodneſs, in this Method of our Redemption, through and by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. Was it neceſſary, as a due Reparation of God's Honour, that the Divine Juſtice muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the Breach of the Firſt Covenant? Who then could be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for ſo vaſt an Undertaking, except the Son of God, who is God Himſelf! The Sufferings of ſuch a Perſon, as a Satisfaction to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, could alone fully proclaim the infinite Guilt of Sin; and, How extreamly God was incenſed againſt it, and could alone ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacifie and atone the Divine Anger thereupon! Was it, again, on the other ſide, requiſite to Man's Reſtoration, that a Covenant ſhould be obtained of ſuch Conditions, as we in our ſtate of Weakneſs might be capable of performing? Who then was ſo proper to propoſe to,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40806:142"/> and obtain of the Father ſuch gracious Terms for us, as one who was himſelf Man, and ſo could be ſenſible of all the Weakneſs and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Man, Sin excepted, and had experienced himſelf what was in the Power of Man to perform?</p>
            <p>Why, all this does of it ſelf appear to have been conſidered in the Divine Wiſdom, and in the Contrivance of Man's Recovery to a ſtate of Salvation, through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour; but for our better aſſurance, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> does expreſly declare it to have been ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. telling us, That ſince he had undertaking to mediate a Peace for us with God, that <hi>therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt, in Things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People: For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> By being God, he was qualified to be a <hi>faithful High Prieſt in Things pertaining to God, and to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People:</hi> That is, as God alone, he knew what Satisfaction was ſufficient to be offered to God, and was fit for him to accept, ere he would be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Sinners; and by being Man, he was alſo qualified <hi>to be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful High Prieſt; for in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted:</hi> That is, as Man, who is ſenſible what Temptations and Infirmities we lie under, he was more proper to be entruſted with the Appointment of ſuch Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as Man was capable to perform; and therefore did preſcribe us a Covenant of Grace, conſiſting accordingly of ſuch reaſonable and performable Conditions.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee alſo by whoſe Mediation we obtained ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, ſuch a ſtate of Salvation; <hi>viz.</hi> that it was <hi>through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let us conſider,<note place="margin">The infinite Care of God the Father to call us into it.</note> as you are alſo taught in your Catechiſm, by whom, and how you are called to this ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And truly, the ſame Heavenly Father who granted us, and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, who purchaſed this ſtate of Salvation for us, have alſo moſt mercifully called us to it.</p>
            <p>And behold and conſider, firſt, I beſeech you, what infinite Care our Heavenly Father hath taken in this great Affair, to call us to this ſtate of Salvation. <hi>And we have ſeen, and do teſtifie,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, that the Father hath ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.14. And how hath he ſent him to ſave it? Why (as was long before propheſied, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1.) He put the <hi>Spirit of the Lord upon him to preach the Goſpel to the Poor; he ſent him to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of Sight to the Blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable Tear of the Lord,</hi> Luke 4.18, 19. Such was the very earneſt Care of the Father, that he Commiſſioned, and ſent his own Son to envite us, his rebellious Creatures and Subjects, to lay down our rebellious Arms againſt him, and to embrace thoſe Overtures and Conditions of Mercy and Salvation, that he offered to us by the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="284" facs="tcp:40806:143"/>

Doing good; that is, executing that Office to which the Father had authorized him, in order to the Salvation of Men; that Office of Mercy, inſtructing and calling of the World to Repentance; and, in order to that, winning 'em to it by other Works of bodily Charity, with which carnal Men are moſt taken, as Curing their Diſeaſes, <hi>Caſting out Devils by the Power of him who was preſent with him.</hi> He <hi>went about doing good</hi> of all kinds, but all in order to the good of Men's Souls; and he was zealous alſo, to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in this bleſſed Work.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How mightily he importuned us to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſtate of Salvation.</note>For, good God! with what mighty Importunity, and winning Rhetorick, did he, the Son of GOD, addreſs himſelf to his own fooliſh Rebellious Subjects, to come into this ſtate, and to receive freely the <hi>Means of Salvation!

Wherefore do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread? and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not?

Encline your Ear, and come unto me; hear, and your Soul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of David.</hi> It is not to be expreſſed nor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with what mighty Zeal and Perſuaſion he did himſelf, whilſt on Earth, purſue this bleſſed Work of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Nor was he contented himſelf, whilſt on Earth, thus to call us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>ſtate of Salvation;</hi> but, moreover, when he was to leave the World, he provided a Succeſſion of Miniſters, which he has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him,<note place="margin">He has left a ſucceſſion of Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him to do the like.</note> to continue to the end of the World, to do the ſame good Office under him, for the Salvation of Mankind, empowering them with the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, to enable 'em to do it effectually: <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> John 20.21.

            <p>And as <hi>he hath committed to us the Word of Reconciliation, we therefore as the Ambaſſadors for Christ, and as though God did beſeech you by us, we do pray you in Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20.

            <pb n="285" facs="tcp:40806:143"/>
            <p>And what, I beſeech you, can be done more? What can be done to call you into a <hi>State of Salvation,</hi> if this will not? When God our Heavenly Father, when Jeſus Chriſt his Son, when his Holy Spirit by his good Inſpirations, when his <hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts,</hi> and a whole Succeſſion of Paſtors and Teachers ſince, do ſpend ſo much Care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this one Work; What can be done more to ſave you?

            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is a matter that infinitely deſerves the deepeſt Senſe, and utmoſt Acknowledgements of the Divine Goodneſs to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider barely the Advantages of having GOD in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, or our own ſingular Happineſs of being called into it.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This great matter of Thankfulneſs, whether we conſider, <hi>1.</hi> The extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Advantage of having God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us.</note> As to the extraordinary Advantage it is to have GOD in Covenant with us (which I have frequent occaſion in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to mind you off) and conſequently that it affords great matter of our Praiſe and Thankſgivings to Him upon that account; it is worthy your notice, that in this caſe, GOD does condeſcend, even to oblige Himſelf by Contract and Agreement with us, whom he might oblige to Obedience by his mere Authority, without any Aſſurance of Reward, that, if we will but do our part, Repent, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Obey, he will be even bound in Juſtice, having given his ſolemn Word and Promiſe for it, to conferr upon us the richeſt Bleſſings that Heaven and Earth can beſtow, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon of Sins, and Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Alas! if we were left to build our Hopes meerly upon the Merit of our own Righteouſneſs and Vertue, we could none of us have the leaſt Expectations of obtaining, as the Reward thereof, ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bleſſings as are now laid up in Heaven for us: But GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending by Covenant to engage himſelf to make 'em good to us, we have thereby the fulleſt Aſſurance given us, that we ſhall obtain thoſe Bleſſings: and upon that Aſſurance, the ſtrongeſt Conſolations and Comforts alſo, to chear us in going through the Difficulties we ſhall meet with in performing thoſe Conditions, whereby only we ſhall obtain ſuch unſpeakable Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>By having GOD in Covenant with us, I ſay, we have the greateſt Aſſurance poſſible, that we ſhall obtain his Favours: To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are very remarkable, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſpeak after the manner of Men, tho' it be but a Man's Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no Man diſannulleth or addeth thereto; now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes</hi> (that is, the Covenant) <hi>made:</hi> Which Words do import, that the deceitful Man will ſcarcely fail to perform, what he has once obliged himſelf by Covenant to do, it is impoſſible that the God of Truth ſhould fail to make good to the utmoſt, thoſe Bleſſings he has enſured to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; that is, to all whom he has vouchſafed to enter into Covenant withal.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:40806:144"/>
            <p>And ſuch Aſſurance given by GOD, does yield alſo the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Conſolations and Comfort. For why? If you'll compare one Scripture with another, you will find, that that which (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2.) GOD does call his Covenant, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13.) is called his Promiſe upon Oath. And what ſays the Apoſtle in that caſe? Why, GOD, ſays he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutability of his Council, confirmed it by Oath,</hi> or by Covenant, <hi>that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the Hope ſet before us; which Hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul, ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the Veil, whither the FORE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NNER is for us entred, even Jeſus.</hi> That is, GOD having aſcertained to us his Bleſſings, by Promiſe upon Oath, or which is tantamount by Covenant, we cannot upon ſuch Aſſurance but have the greateſt Comfort and Hopes of obtaining thoſe Bleſſings, and ſo of following, ere long, that Jeſus which is gone before us into Heaven, <hi>to prepare a Place for us; that where he is, there we may be alſo,</hi> John 14.2, 3. So that it is an invaluable Privilege, this, of which the World can never be ſufficiently ſenſible, nor thankful to God for, that he vouchſafed to enſure his Mercies to 'em by Covenant. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The occaſion of your Thankfulneſs is yet greater, if you conſider your own ſingular Happineſs,<note place="margin">Or, <hi>2.</hi> Our ſingular Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs therein, above the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels, or the reſt of Mankind.</note> in being called into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and in having all God's Mercies thereby ſecured to you, when ſo many millions of his Creatures do want this Favour. The Words of your Catechiſm do teach every one of you to conſider his own particular Intereſt in this Covenant, as the proper matter of his Thankſgiving to God: Every one of you is taught to anſwer for himſelf in particular, <hi>I thank God our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> And indeed, if we are naturally moſt affected with, and moſt ſenſible of thoſe Benefits, which we ſee ſo many beſides our ſelves to want, here is occaſion for the deepeſt Senſe, and utmoſt Acknowledgments of GOD's Goodneſs to you, that you have been called into this <hi>State of Salvation,</hi> when ſo many millions beſides, both Angels and Men, do want the Benefit of it.</p>
            <p>As to the fallen Angels, the Covenant of Graces wa a Favour never afforded by God to them; for Chriſt, that he might <hi>deliver them who all their life-time were ſubject to Bondage, verily took not on him the Nature of Angels, but took upon him the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15, 16</p>
            <p>And as to Mens, alas! there are many Nations now in the World, who have not yet enjoyed ſo infinite a Bleſſing, as this happy Call into a <hi>State of Salvation;</hi> who have not yet heard of a Saviour, nor the good Tidings of the Goſpel, or <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> who have had no Apoſtles, no Evangeliſts, no Paſtors nor Teachers amongſt 'em, and who therefore ſtill lie gropling in Darkneſs, and the ſhadow of Death. And perhaps amongſt thoſe Nations that are called, there are not any that enjoy the Means of Salvation, the Worſhip of GOD, the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and the Preaching of the Word, in that purity and force, as we in this Church and Nation do. It is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40806:144"/> indeed an unſpeakable Bleſſing we enjoy above many other People: <hi>For now in Jeſus Chriſt, we who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the Bloud of Christ, who is our Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.13, 14. <hi>And are no more Strangers and Foreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
            <p>It is counted a great Privilege amongſt Men but to enjoy the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a City, or Corporation, as that which puts thoſe who enjoy it, above the Condition of Strangers, and gives 'em to partake of many ſingular Advantages which Foreigners want: But by being taken as <hi>Fellow-Citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, we are Enfranchiſed Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> whereby we are entituled to all thoſe Privileges which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us, which are unſpeakable and invaluable, and which does place us, as has been often ſaid, in ſo much a better State and Condition than the reſt of Mankind. Such infinite reaſon have we <hi>heartily to Thank Almighty God our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called us to this State of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>

            <p>And indeed ſince ſuch is the Frame and Conſtitution of Humane Nature,<note place="margin">To have ſome outward Rites and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, agreeable to the Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as being moſt apt to receive Impreſſions from ſenſible Things.</note> that nothing enters into our Minds, but through the Door of our Senſes; and that which does ſtrike our bodily Senſes, does make the deepeſt and moſt laſting Impreſſion upon us; ſince indeed it is ſo with us, it was very agreeable with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to have that Reſpect to our Make and Nature in his Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, as at the ſame time he threw away the many burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Ceremonies of the Law, to retain ſo many, and ſuch at leaſt, as whereby we might be made more ſenſible of our Engagements to God, and be the better aſſured of his gracious Promiſes unto us. And therefore ſince all Men, in their Covenants one with another, ever uſed ſome Outward and Expreſs Solemnities of Signing and Sealing, for the better Aſſurance of the Performance of Promiſes on both ſides; it was no ways diſagreeable to the Wiſdom of our Saviour in ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, nor with the ſpiritual Nature of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that we ſhould tranſact it with God in ſuch a way and manner, as might make us more deeply ſenſible of our Obligations by it, and more full of Hopes of Benefit and Advantages from it.</p>
            <p>It was truly well obſerved by the Father,<note place="margin">This eſpecially requiſite in the admiſſion into Religious Societies and Covenants.</note> 
               <hi>That Men can be aſſociated together in no Religion, whether true or falſe, unleſs they he combined by the common Tie of ſome ſenſible Signs and Sacraments of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> For this reaſon, it is like, that a Viſible Sign, or Sacrament, might be a continual and apparent Remembrance to 'em, and put 'em in Mind of that Profeſſion they took upon 'em by that Rite; and that it might be a Viſible Teſtimony and Witneſs againſt 'em, if they ſhould ever act contrary to that Profeſſion. Hence therefore all the Religions we hear of in the World, have had their ſolemn Rites of <hi>Initiation</hi> or <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into 'em.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were initiated both by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſm.</note> they were initiated into the Covenant God made with them, by the Ceremony of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Figure or Form of Speech, very uſual in the mention of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (where the Sign is often put for the Thing ſignified) the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their Fleſh,</hi> Gen. 17.13. it being the Sign in their Fleſh of their Covenant with God. The <hi>Jews</hi> alſo had their Baptiſms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they admitted their Proſelytes, or Gentile-Converts, into their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and by Baptiſm they ſay, all their Women who never were Circumciſed, and both Men and Women, during their ſojourning in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40806:147"/> the Wilderneſs (when Circumciſion was diſpenſed with, becauſe it would make them ſore for Travelling.) By Baptiſm therefore they were entred into Covenant; and this ſeems alſo to be clear from that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. <hi>They were all Baptized into</hi> Moſes, or Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into the Religion of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Heathens were initiated into their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Waſhings.</note> 
               <hi>in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> And indeed the very Heathens likewiſe, they were initiated into their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Worſhip, by ſome ſolemn Rites or other, and that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Purgations and Waſhings.</p>
            <p>And now agreeably to both, the Rite, or Ceremony whereby our Saviour appointed that we ſhould be Initiated into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or the Chriſtian Religion, was <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or Waſhing. As our Bleſſed Saviour, out of his Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, did ordain, That agreeably to our Humane Nature, which is moſt ſenſibly touch'd with Outward Things, the Covenant betwixt him and us ſhould be tranſacted by Outward and Expreſs Solemnities;<note place="margin">Our Saviour choſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as what would be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to both Parties.</note> ſo he was not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of having it done by ſuch Outward Rites, as were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and acceptable both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the Rite of Initiation into the <hi>Legal Covenant,</hi> he would not adopt into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> becauſe it was deteſtable, and had in abomination by the greateſt part of the Heathen World; but <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> or Waſhing, none could accept againſt it, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> It was uſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as Circumciſion, to initiate their Proſelytes into Covenant, as was before ſaid; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did as often uſe it in a Sacramental Manner, when they were entred into any of the Heathen Myſteries of their Pagan Worſhip; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when on any extraordinary Occaſion they profeſſed their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as appears from <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour's ſo ſolemnly Waſhing his Hands, when he would declare himſelf clear of ſhedding the Innocent Bloud of the Holy JESUS,<note place="margin">Eſpecially as more ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Purity.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24. And indeed, as on the account of its agreeableneſs to all Parties; ſo chiefly, no doubt, he choſe it for the Sacrament of the Chriſtian Religion, on this laſt ſcore, <hi>viz.</hi> its being ſo ſignificative of the Cleanneſs from the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, of the Purity and Holineſs that all Chriſtians are to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. As Waſhing purges and cleanſes the Body from Dirt and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo our Saviour choſe the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Tit. 3.5. to be the Rite or Ceremony whereby all his Diſciples ſhould be initiated or entred into his Covenant, or Religion, to ſignifie that all his Diſciples muſt be Pure and Holy, not polluted with the Sins and Wickedneſſes of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And this he has enjoined, as indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to our initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Covenant of Grace.</note>And ſo indiſpenſible a Rite of our <hi>Initiation</hi> or Entrance into the Covenant of Grace did our Saviour make it, that he did not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Apoſtles, and all the ſucceeding Miniſters of his Church to the end of the World, to Baptize thoſe whom they did proſelyte over to his Religion, <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>and teach,</hi> or diſciple, by Baptizing 'em, <hi>all Nations, and lo I am with you always to the end of the World:</hi> But he excludes all others fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> having any Intereſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which he vouchſafed unto us, and from having any claim to the Promiſes of it, who are not Entred into it by the Outward Rite and Solemnity, or Ceremony of Baptiſm. Thus he tells <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> with a <hi>Verily, verily;</hi> that is, with a ſolemn Aſſeveration, which amounts almoſt to an Oath, That <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40806:147"/> of God, is here meant the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> which is a Society of Men in Covenant with God, enjoying certain ineſtimable Privileges under Chriſt their Supream Head; and is often in the New Teſtament called the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. So that it is plain from hence, that there is no admittance to the Privileges of the Goſpel, or New Covenant, which are Grace, Pardon, and Happineſs; nor to the Enjoyment of thoſe infinite Rewards in Heaven, the chief of all the Mercies of the Covenant, without being firſt entred into the Church by Baptiſm, which is the Oatward Seal and Confirmation of thoſe Mercies to us; <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And agreeably to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Lord and Maſter, did the Great St. <hi>Peter</hi> hold Baptiſm ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary, that he ordered even thoſe Perſons, upon whom at his Preaching of the Word the Holy Ghoſt had fallen (which one would have thought might render Baptiſm unneceſſary) yet he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered even thoſe to be Baptized withal, as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10.46, 47, 48. <hi>Then anſwered</hi> Peter, <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be Baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them</hi> (Commanded whom? why, thoſe on whom the Holy Ghoſt had fallen, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. and) <hi>who had received the Holy Ghoſt as well as he,</hi> verſ. 47. he commanded even thoſe <hi>to be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus is Baptiſm you ſee an Outward Rite or Ceremony of our Saviour's own Appointment, for the ſolemn admitting of Perſons into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And thus our Saviour appointed us to be entred into the Covenant of Grace, <hi>for the better Confirmation and Aſſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's part, and the Conditions on ours; it being thus mutually and interchangeably, as it were, Sealed to betwixt God and us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baptiſm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Rite of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Covenant of Grace, for the better Confirmation and Aſſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's part, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on ours, it being thus mutually and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably Sealed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As in this ſacred Rite of Baptiſm, there are two Parties concerned; God, who by his Miniſter, or <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> and Agent, as he is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. does admit the Perſon Baptized to Covenant, and does by him promiſe and engage to conferr upon him, particular Bleſſings and Favours; and the Party Baptized, who preſents himſelf, or is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by others; and does ſolemnly engage to <hi>Renounce</hi> GOD's Enemies, <hi>the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, to Believe in God, and to Obey him:</hi> As there are Two Parties, I ſay, God and Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus tranſacting a Covenant together; ſo the Miniſter, God's Agent, his Receiving the Party, and <hi>Baptizing him in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is the Sealing to it on God's part, who has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to confirm in Heaven, what they in his Name, and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſhall <hi>bind on Earth,</hi> Matth. 16.19. And the Party preſenting himſelf, or being preſented to Baptiſm, and therein expreſly vowing to perform the fore-mentioned Conditions, and in token of that, his being waſhed or ſprinkled with Water, is the putting to, as it were, his Seal to the Counterpart of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>And farther, as this mutual Covenanting and Sealing, does give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, beſides his <hi>Right of Creation,</hi> a farther Right by our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Engagements, to our Obedience and Service; ſo to us it gives (even that which we could otherwiſe have, no, not the leaſt Pretenſions
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40806:148"/> to) even a <hi>Legal Right and Title</hi> to all the moſt ineſtimable Bleſſings and Favours of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It gives great Aſſurance of mutual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances barely to be in Cavenant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>It has been already more than once hinted, and ſhall here be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, how that it gives us mighty Aſſurance, that the Mercies of God ſhall certainly be conferred on us; that he has vouchſafed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Himſelf in Covenant to make 'em good unto us; and that becauſe this way of proceeding gives us even a <hi>Legal Right and Title</hi> to <hi>All</hi> the moſt ineſtimable Bleſſings and Favours of the Covenant. For this we are to conſider, that 'till ſuch time as God has condeſcended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ſo and ſo, the utmoſt Services that we can pay him, cannot give us ſure and certain grounds to hope for, or expect ſuch invaluable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to be conferred upon us. Though we ſhould never ſo heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent us of our Sins, there is not that in Repentance alone, that it ſhould be ſufficient of it ſelf to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and to ſalve that infinite Diſhonour we have done him by our former Violations of his ſacred Laws: And though we ſhould never ſo ſincerely and faithfully Obey him for the future, is it poſſible that ſuch unprofitable Service as ours, ſhould merit and deſerve of it ſelf, the unſpeakable and unconceivable Joys of Heaven, as a due Reward for ſuch Obedient Service? Pardon of our manifold Sins and Offences, and eternal Joy and Happineſs, I ſay, can never be expected meerly upon any Merit there is in our Repentance and Obedience; nor at all, 'till ſuch time as he has graciouſly vouchſafed, and freely condeſcended by Covenant, to ſecure ſuch Benefits unto us, upon our ſerious Repentance and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience.</p>
            <p>But then when he has once condeſcended to enſure unto us by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, theſe unſpeakable Benefits, and we, on the other ſide, have alſo engaged our ſelves to the Performance of ſuch Conditions; then, what our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, could not give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect or hope for, meerly upon the account of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſhall however be aſcertained to us by virtue of God's Covenant-Obligations, which he has laid upon himſelf: And Pardon and eternal Happineſs ſhall be ſo far then the matter of our Hopes and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we ſhall have a <hi>Legal Claim</hi> and Title made over to us, upon our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience to 'em; inſomuch that God will reckon himſelf (as has been before ſaid) in Juſtice and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bound, both upon the account of Chriſt's Purchaſe, and his own Covenanted Promiſes, to <hi>forgive us our Sins,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. and will then own us to have a <hi>Right to the Tree of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. We ſhall then, I ſay, have a Right and Title to the Bleſſings of the Covenant, not by virtue of any Outward Merit and Deſert in our Performances, but by virtue of the Divine Promiſes and Engagements to thoſe, who having ſolemnly entred into Covenant with him, do take care faithfully to perform the Conditions of it. So that this alone gives us mighty Aſſurance of the Divine Mercies, that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled thereunto, by his having Covenanted them unto us; as well as he is the more entitled to our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, becauſe we have Covenanted to perform 'em.</p>
            <p>But yet the more firmly to entitle, as God, to our Obedience; ſo us, to his Mercies; becauſe we never take our ſelves to be ſo well enſured of the performance of Articles, as when we have 'em ſolemnly ſealed to by both Parties; God did therefore, in compliance with our own
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40806:148"/> Ways and Methods, graciouſly pleaſe to Seal to his part, the Promiſes; and required us to do the like to our part, the Conditions, that he might be the better ſecured of our Covenanted Performances, and we of his promiſed Mercies. And then ſince he has condeſcended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto us, not only by meer Covenant, but moreover to ſeal unto us theſe unſpeakable Benefits; and we, on the other ſide, have alſo ſacramentally ſealed to the Counter-part of the Covenant, the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it; what can there be further thought of to entitle God to our Obedience, or us to his Mercies?</p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice, as to the Sacrament, or Solemnity, whereby we entred into the Covenant of Grace, which was by Baptiſm. Baptiſm, as you have ſeen, is an Outward Rite or Sacrament of our Saviour's own Appointment, for the ſolemn admitting of Perſons into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, inſtituted by Chriſt for the better Confirmation and Inſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's part, and the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on ours; it being thus mutually ſealed to, betwixt God and us. For, agreeably to our Frame and Nature, as I have told you, which conſiſts of Bodily Senſes, as well as Spiritual Faculties, God has given us, beſides thoſe moſt rational Terms and Conditions of the Covenant Recorded in the Goſpel, being ſuch Promiſes as are becoming the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God to make, and ſuch Conditions as are highly befitting us to perform; beſides theſe, he has appointed to us thoſe Outward and Expreſs Solemnities we call the Sacraments, to ſeal theſe Things betwixt us. And becauſe that Baptiſm is a Rite moſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative in it ſelf, and would be moſt acceptable to all ſorts of People, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he was therefore pleaſed to <hi>Adopt</hi> that to be the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of our Entrance into, and Sealing the Covenant with him. And this Covenant you have ſeen he would have thus mutually Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to betwixt Him and us, that the Obligations to Performance might be the ſtronger upon us both, to diſcharge each his part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſpoke to the Sacrament, or Solemnity, whereby we enter into Covenant, evpreſs'd in theſe Words, <hi>In my Baptiſm;</hi> the next thing to be ſhewed you is, the great Obligation which lies upon us to perform this our Covenant with God.</p>

To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it would be exceedingly well worth your while, to conſult, and throughly conſider, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. where you have ſuch
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40806:149"/> Characters given of the Church of Chriſt, and the Members of it, as ſpeak it to be a ſelected, ſeparated Body of Men, who are <hi>Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as it were, to God's Service. And ſuch Inferences are drawn from thence, concerning living at an excellent rate upon that very ſcore, as ſpeak the ſtrongeſt Obligations upon all the Members of Chriſt's Church to approve themſelves therefore, upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, excellent Men. In the 8th.

               <hi>A Royal Preiſthood:</hi> This is an alluſion to <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. <hi>Now therefore, if ye will obey my Voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a Peculiar Treaſure unto me above all People; and ye ſhall be a Kingdom of Prieſts, and an Holy Nation.</hi> As the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſeparated from the reſt of the World, peculiarly to ſerve the True God; ſo were the Order of Prieſthood ſeparated from amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to a greater degree of Holineſs, and nearer Service to him, than the reſt of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and for that reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie a greater Purity in them than the common <hi>Jews.</hi> Thoſe very Outward Blemiſhes, which were no Impediment to the other <hi>Jews,</hi> but that they might approach God, as far as to Lay-men was permitted, wer a barr to the Prieſts, that they could not thereupon Execute the Prieſtly Office: <hi>Speak unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaying, Whoſoever he be of thy Seed in his Generations, that hath any Blemiſh, let him not appear to offer the Bread of his God; for whatſoever he be that hath a Blemiſh, he ſhall not approach; a blind Man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat Noſe, or any thing ſuperfluous,</hi> Levit. 21.17, 18.

               <note place="margin">Chriſtians choſe both from amongſt Jews and Gentiles, to a more peculiar Holineſs.</note>And now to bring this to our preſent caſe: Does St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, in his Character of the Church of Chriſt, call it a <hi>Choſen Generation, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People?</hi> Why, what does it import, but that the Members of Chriſt's Church muſt ſtudy to diſtinguiſh themſelves, as much now from the Infidel part of the World, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Piety and Devotion towards God, Juſtice and Charity towards their Neighbour, and a ſubjecting of their Luſts and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites to right Reaſon, which is the great Duty to themſelves? I ſay, Chriſtians muſt as much diſtinguiſh themſelves from the profane Crew of Idolatrous and Wicked Heathens, and Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> by an exact and regular, and a better Life; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Idolatrous and Wicked Heathens in thoſe days, by a Ritual Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Nay, And does he call us a <hi>Royal Prieſthood?</hi> Why, this he does here, and alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. where we are told, That <hi>Chriſt hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father.</hi> And what doth this import, but that we are as much to exceed both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in holy Living, as the Prieſts among the <hi>Jews</hi> were to excel the reſt of the People in a <hi>Legal</hi> Purity and Cleanneſs? Chriſtians are to ſhew themſelves to be Kings, by their Victories over the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, over Sin and Satan; and they are to be, as it were, Prieſts, becauſe they are to <hi>preſent their Bodies a living Sacrifice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acceptable unto God, which is our reaſonable Service, and are not to be conformed to this World, but to be transformed by the renewing of their Minds,</hi> Rom. 12.1, 2. And are to <hi>offer up the Sacrifice of Praiſe continually, the Praiſes of God,</hi> Heb. 13.15. They are to offer cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40806:150"/> Alms, which are called <hi>an Odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable and well-pleaſing unto God,</hi> Phil 4.18. This is the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thoſe high Expreſſions of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and this indeed do the following Words declare: <hi>But ye are a Choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of Him, who hath called us out of Darkneſs into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed ſo much it concerns us who are <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> to diſtinguiſh our ſelves from the reſt of the World by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lives, far above other People; that our Bleſſed Saviour came into the World, died, and ſuffered all thoſe ſtupendious Things recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Goſpel, all on this very Deſign, To purchaſe ſuch a Body of Men, that ſhould more peculiarly and zealouſly ſerve God, and to work and perſuade us to it. Thus <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. it is ſaid, That <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence were all his Diſcourſes and Preachings to us, (eſpecially that moſt divine Sermon upon the Mount,) to raiſe all his Diſciples and Followers to the higheſt pitch and perfection of moral Vertue and Goodneſs: <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them,</hi> Matth. 5.27. That is, to enlarge and encreaſe our Duties to God and Man, and to our ſelves; to make the Obedience of the Heart, as neceſſary as that of the outward Man; to make the very Thoughts of Uncleanneſs criminal, as well as Adultery it ſelf. And, in a word, hence does he require of us his Members, that our <hi>Light ſhould ſo ſhine before Men, that they might ſee our good Works, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> verſ. 16. That is, he requires that by the Eminence of all divine Graces and Vertues ſhining in our Lives, we ſhould be as a Candle ſet on an Hill to enlighten the benighted and bewildred World, ſtraying in the darkneſs of Ignorance and Errour, that they might find their way by the Brightneſs of our Examples, to Heaven and Happineſs. And by the ſavourlineſs, laſtly, of our good Converſation, he requires that we ſhould be as Salt in the World, to ſeaſon the corrupted Manners of Men. Such ſtrong Obligations lie upon us,, as <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> to be faithful in our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is, to perform all due Obedience unto God.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40806:151"/> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live and move, and have our Being, for we are his Offspring.</hi> But conſider us who are Baptized Chriſtians farther, as the Children of God by Adoption, and then over and above our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all that belongs to it, our Well-being alſo both in this and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life, is wholly of his Gift: <hi>For if Children of God,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does argue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.) <hi>then Heirs, Heirs with God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt; ſo that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be alſo glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if for Life and Being, and alſo for all that Well-being<note place="margin">Children of God, as owing both Being and Well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> too which we have, or hope to enjoy in this, or the Life to come, we wholly and entirely depend upon God our Father; Do we not then owe to him as his Children, all the Duty, all the Obſervance, and all the Diligence poſſible, in the diſcharge of ſuch Duty and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? This the very Light of Nature teaches us; but the Scripture does moſt expreſly, upon that very ſcore of being his Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us: <hi>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter,</hi> ſays God by his Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I then be a Father, where is mine Honour? And if I be a Master, where is my Fear?</hi> And upon the ſame ſcore of our being Children of God, does St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt earneſtly exhort us to a Renunciation of the World, and our filthy Luſts, and to a faithful and careful diſcharge of our Duty to God our Father: <hi>As Obedient Children,</hi> ſays he, 1 Epiſt. 1.14, 15. <hi>not faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your ſelves according to the former Luſts in your Ignorance; but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>If ye call on the Father,</hi> (that is, profeſs your ſelves the Sons of your Heavenly Father) <hi>who without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, judgeth every Man according to his Works,</hi> can ſee Blemiſhes, and will puniſh Faults, as well in his Children as others; if you profeſs your ſelves the Children of ſuch a Father, <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> is the Inference the ſame Apoſtle makes from this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of being the Children of God.</p>
            <p>And indeed, except we do give up our ſelves ſincerely and faithfully to obey God, and in all Points to diſcharge our Covenant with him, we are in effect not the <hi>Children of God,</hi> however Baptized, and ſo in Profeſſion, but in reality are the Children of the Devil, and from him muſt expect our Reward: So St. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, 1 Epiſt. 3.8, 9. <hi>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil;</hi> that is, he that committeth any act of known Sin, is in that, ſo far from being a <hi>Child of God,</hi> that he is a Child of the Devil, of whom, and not of God, he is an Imitator; <hi>For whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> That is, as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> does Paraphraſe upon the ſame place, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a true Child of God, keeps himſelf ſtrictly from every delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Act of Sin; and the reaſon is, Becauſe that contrary Principle of Regeneration, or Sonſhip (from which he is ſaid to be born of God) if that continue to have any Life or Energy in it, is utterly contrary and incompatible with Sin. And then does follow that Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical diſtinguiſhing Mark he does give of a Child of God, and a Child of the Devil, ſhewing the grand difference between one and the other. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſted, and the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of God,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:40806:151"/>
            <p>In a word, to conclude this Argument alſo: As it is almoſt natural, and therefore ever expected, that Children ſhould imitate the Life and Manners of their Parents; and if they prove diſſolute, and of looſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, it does uſually redound to the Parents diſgrace, as generally ſuppoſed to proceed from ſlackneſs of Government; ſo, ſhould we who are Children of God, be <hi>Covenant-Breakers,</hi> prove lawleſs and diſſolute Livers, it will extreamly tend to the Diſhonour of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, whoſe Name is then <hi>hallowed</hi> amongſt Men, when we his profeſſed Sons and Servants, do dutifully and ſincerely fulfill our Engagements to Him; but, on the contrary, is then blaſphemed, when we live ungodly Lives. So that this grand Favour and Privilege of being the Sons of God, is another moſt powerful Argument to render us faithful in our Covenant with Him. And ſo likewiſe it is,</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be an <hi>Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

                  <hi>3.</hi> As Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint will it put upon a young Heir, and how careful will it make him to pleaſe his Parents, when a great Eſtate is like to deſcend upon him; but yet ſo, that he ſhall certainly be diſinherited of it, except he behave himſelf ſoberly, and regularly, and dutifully to thoſe his Parents! And if ſo, how infinitely more circumſpect, and wary, and diligent ſhould we all of us be, to pleaſe <hi>our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> by diſcharging our Covenant-Engagements to him, inaſmuch as the Heavenly Inheritance is of infinite more value than an Earthly one can be.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtand now to give you a deſcription of that <hi>Exceeding Weight of Glory,</hi> and of thoſe Vaſt and Immenſe Treaſures of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are laid up in Heaven for thoſe who ſhall faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Covenant with God; I ſhall only in ſhort ſhew you, that ſuch is the Nature and Conſtitution of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that there is no Hopes nor Expectations of ever obtaining it, without a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of all our Covenant-Engagements to God; and if ſo, then certainly there cannot be greater Obligations poſſible to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of 'em. And as to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, ſurely one would think it were needleſs to prove, that the Conditions of it muſt be performed, or we cannot expect to inherit the Promiſes. This is of the Nature of all Covenants whatſoever, which conſiſt of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Promiſes and Benefits to be made good on one part, not without certain Conditions to be performed on the other. And why then ſhould any ſo fondly expect <hi>Justification</hi> and Happineſs to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon 'em, except they do <hi>Repent heartily, Believe practically,</hi> and <hi>Obey ſincerely,</hi> the only Conditions of this Covenant,<note place="margin">Kingdom of Heaven not to be expected, but by thoſe who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Covenant.</note> as has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhewed? Why, ſure none that look into the Goſpel, and ſee and conſider, how that all along Happineſs is only promiſed to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, can ever expect it upon other Terms. But ſo it is, that a ſort of <hi>Antinomian</hi> Hereticks do ſpread abroad their peſtilent Doctrines, teaching that Chriſt by his Sacrifice and Satisfaction for us, has purchaſed Juſtification and Happineſs, without any Conditions to be perform'd on our part; and, that what he has done will wholly excuſe us from Duty and Obedience. But this is one of the moſt Antichriſtian Errours in the World, as undermining the whole deſign of Chriſt's Coming, and his Preaching the Goſpel amongſt us; which was to tie us up to higher Rules of Righteouſneſs, than were before given to the Sons of

It was infinitely far from the Deſign of him, who came to ſave and deliver us from the Power and Dominion, as well as from the Guilt and Puniſhment of our Sins, to do any thing that ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in Sin, and render us ſecure when at any time we commit it. But that which Chriſt has done for us, amounts to this, that he has purchaſed, by his Blood-ſhedding, an Abrogation of the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein was no Happineſs without an Unſinning Obedience; and then has procured for us this moſt gracious Covenant, with theſe abatements of rigour, That we ſhall have all that unſpeakable Bliſs, and the <hi>Inheritance of Heaven</hi> conferred on us, on condition we ſhall repent of, and forſake our Sins, and knowingly and willingly not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him for the future.</p>
            <p>And a moſt encouraging Argument this will be to all conſidering and ſerious Perſons, to make 'em faithful and diligent to perform their Covenant. No People, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ever before us had the like. The <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the meer Covenant of Works, had plainly and expreſly the Aſſurances only of a temporal <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Promiſes of a peaceable and proſperous Poſſeſſion thereof, to encourage their Duty. And the poor Pagans had little Inducements to vertuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, more than the preſent Tranquility of Mind, which ariſes from the meer exerciſe of Vertue; neither of 'em Conſiderations ſtrong enough to bear us up againſt great Temptations to ſin, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the way of our Duty. But this one Conſideration of an <hi>eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> an Inheritance laid up in Heaven, a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> infallibly enſured to thoſe who ſhall <hi>be faithful unto Death:</hi> This is enough to encourage us in Well-doing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus you ſee what mighty Arguments the ſeveral Mercies of the Covenant made over to us on God's part, do yield us; and what inviolable Obligations they do all of 'em lay upon us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wed.</note> And there are two ſorts of theſe Vows, which are to be diſtinguiſh'd according to the matter of which the Vow is made: For ſometimes the thing which we have vowed to do,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40806:153"/> was not a Duty upon us, 'till ſuch time as we made ſuch a Vow; as when a Perſon does ſolemnly promiſe to God, that he well ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſuch a Portion of his Time, ſuch a Day of the Week, for the more immediate Service of God, in Faſting and Prayer; or that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote ſuch a part of his Eſtate or Gains for pious or charitable Uſes. Secondly, again, the matter of a Vow may be what was incumbent upon us before, only the Vow is added to ſtrengthen the Obligation: And ſuch is the Vow was made in our Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Sometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, and ſuch is the matter of our Baptiſmal Vow.</note> whereby we were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and in a peculiar manner Devoted and Conſecrated to God's Service, and to live to his Glory; which though it was a Duty upon us before, yet now we have farther obliged our ſelves thereunto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſolemnly vowed ſo to do. Generally the matter of a Vow is of the former ſort, ſomething to which we were not obliged before; as when <hi>Jacob</hi> did vow to <hi>build an Houſe to God,</hi> Gen. 28.22. And of this nature are all thoſe Lands and Poſſeſſions, over and above the Tythe, or tenth Part, which have been devoted and given by the Piety of well-diſpoſed Perſons, for the maintenance of the Miniſters and the Worſhip of God, for the Education of Children in Schools, and the Relief of the Poor in Hoſpitals. Before they were devoted to pious and charitable Uſes, they were ſo far in the Power of the Party who own'd 'em, as that he might diſpoſe of 'em how, and to what Uſes he pleaſed. But after a Vow is once made by our ſelves or Forefathers, whereby ſuch a Part of an Eſtate is determinately ſet aſide for ſacred Uſes, it is then <hi>a devoted thing.</hi>

            <p>And I will be bold to add (and I will endeavour to prove it) that for that very reaſon of its having been Vowed and Devoted to God, it is one of the moſt provoking Sins in the World to <hi>rob God</hi> of it.<note place="margin">'Tis a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Sin to rob God of what has been once Vowed and Devoted to him, tho' of the former Nature.</note> This is plainly ſeen, in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Acts 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Theſe two Perſons, ſtirr'd up at firſt, as is probable, with a like pious Zeal for the promotion of Religion, with many others of the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity, had ſold a Poſſeſſion, and given it to the Church (which according to the Circumſtances of thoſe Times, was of more uſe than if ſetled upon it) but Covetouſneſs afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon their Hearts, they <hi>kept back part of the Price,</hi> and laid a ſhare of it only <hi>at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> v. 3. But obſerve how ſeverely <hi>Peter</hi> rebukes 'em for this Sacrilege: Before they had devoted it, he tells 'em they might have done what they would with it; but firſt to beſtow it wholly on the Church, and then <hi>to keep back part of the Price</hi> of the Land, he calls this <hi>a Lying to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (for the terrour of other ſacrilegious Invaders of Things devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) puniſhes it with one of the moſt ſudden and fearful Deaths that we find recorded, either in the Scripture, or profane Story. This Sin of with-holding or ſeizing of any thing once Vowed and Devoted by our ſelves or others to ſacred Uſes, is called the Sin of Sacrilege, and is ſpoke of, as ſeems by the manner of expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. as a Sin equalling the Guilt even of Idolatry it ſelf.</p>

But let
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40806:154"/> this ſuffice to ſhew how heinous a thing it is to violate a Vow to God, even where the matter of the Vow hath been ſomething to which there was no Obligation before ſuch Vow.</p>
            <p>And will it be leſs provoking then, think ye, to violate thoſe Vows, wherein by ſolemn Engagements, Men have promiſed to do that which before ſuch Vows and Promiſes they were obliged to from the Law of Nature,<note place="margin">'Tis much more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to violate Vows; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form which, were antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently obliged by the Law of Nature.</note> and as a Debt due for their very Creation and Being? In this caſe, there is a double Obligation to perform ſuch Vows: When that which was commanded to be done, and is neceſſary upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, is with all ſolemnity engaged to be performed, then the Vow does add to the Command, a new and farther Obligation, which will make it more criminal, and a far more heinous Sin to break ſuch Vows. There are many of this kind recorded in the Scripture, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the firſt part of that Vow of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.21. is of this kind; and ſo is our <hi>Baptiſmal Vow</hi> to perform the Covenant of Grace: We were obliged to perform all that Duty, which we therein engaged to perform, by the very Law of Nature, upon the account of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dependence upon God, from whom, as a Fountain, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all the Good we already have, and hope to enjoy. But when, moreover, we come ſolemnly and expreſly to engage our ſelves to the performance of ſuch Conditions, we add ſtrength to our former Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, tying 'em faſter upon our ſelves; and in the breach of the Laws of God, we thenceforward become not only barely diſobedient, but moreover faithleſs and <hi>Covenant-breakers,</hi> and ſhall be therefore puniſh'd, not only as diſobedient, but alſo as faithleſs and perfidious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>
            <p>Nor does it in the leaſt leſſen the Obligation, that this Vow was made by others for you in your Infancy; for not to prove to you now, which ſhall be done in its due place, that it is in the Power of Parents or Guardians, to oblige their Minors to the Performance of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without their own expreſs Conſent at that time, provided there ſhall conſiderable Advantages accrue to 'em thereby; it is moreover plain from Scripture, that Parents may devote their Children to the Service of God in a very peculiar manner; and therefore they had Power to devote us to the Worſhip of the True God, as preſcribed us in the Goſpel, or New Covenant; to which Covenant we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand obliged, as much as if in our Perſons we had Vowed and Engaged our ſelves to perform it. Of this Power in Parents we ſee an inſtance in <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. Nor is the thing contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and natural Equity, the Philoſopher himſelf affirming, that both the Parents may devote the Children whilſt young, as they pleaſe, ſince Children at that Age are to be accounted not ſo much at their own, as at their Parents diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>The thing is juſt and reaſonable, and therefore it is highly criminal in us to break that Baptiſmal Vow.<note place="margin">A Vow is much of the nature of an Oath, and therefore to violate it is Perjury.</note> It is a ſin much of the nature of Perjury, a Vow and an Oath being promiſcuouſly uſed in Scripture, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.13. one for another. And indeed as to our Baptiſmal Vow, ſince therein God is made a Witneſs, a Judge, and a Revenger, it is in its full importance no leſs than and Oath, and the violating thereof would be Perjury. He is called to, as a Witneſs of our Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in what we do promiſe, and oblige our ſelves thereby to do: He is appeal'd to, as a Judge of our Performance, whether we are faithful
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40806:154"/> or not. And as he is a God that will not be mocked, he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a Revenger, and a ſevere one too, if we ſhall falſly and perfidiouſly brake our Vows of <hi>Renouncing the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, of Believing in God, and Obeying Him;</hi> and ſhall, on the contrary, give our ſelves up to the Service of Sin and Satan, live like thoſe that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not God, nor the Chriſtian Religion, and in perfect contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Apoſtle's Rule, <hi>deny</hi> not <hi>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts,</hi> as we are commanded, and have promiſed; but deny to <hi>live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World.</hi> In ſuch a caſe, I ſay, he will be a ſevere Revenger of our Perjury, and of our <hi>Apostacy;</hi> I ſay of our <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> for he will then conſider us not as ordinary Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but as thoſe who have in effect renounced our Religion, and will allot to us therefore not the ordinary meaſures of Puniſhment due to unbelieving <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> but extraordinary ones, ſuch as are due to faithleſs and perfidious <hi>Renegado's.</hi> Oh, it had been happy for us, if we had never been Baptized; if after thoſe Vows we have therein made, to do all we can to deſtroy <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Power of Sin in the World, we ſhall fight againſt God by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and wicked Deeds, <hi>Better it is that thou ſhouldſt not Vow, than that thou ſhouldſt Vow, and not pay,</hi> Eccl. 5.5. It is a leſs fault not to Vow at all, than having Vowed, not to perform; the one being but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, the other an Affront, nay, a Contempt of his Majeſty, who will not ſuffer a ſcorn to be put upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay? why take therefore the Advice of the Wiſe Man, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto God, deferr not to pay it: for he hath no pleaſure in Fools; pay that which thou haſt Vowed:</hi> And ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely with Holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments;</hi> I have ſolemnly reſolved, and bound my ſelf by the moſt ſacred Ties, which I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver break, but do now confirm; that I will carefully <hi>perform my part of the Covenant,</hi> which I find to be moſt juſt and good.</p>
